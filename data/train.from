This your revenge ? 
We 're not in love . 
But I was stupid .

It can be a disadvantage . 
And when we stop doing it , we 'll be dead . 
I 'm really feeling bad lately . 
Didn 't you catch a robber at that time ? 
Oh , the robber . 
I was the one who caught the robber . 
Being lead down an annoying path .

Don 't move , General , if you don 't want to die . 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
Hatred of that man is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible .

The trouble with real life is , there 's no danger music . 
Poor child of mine . 
If it finds evil , it stops . 
See how they cry . 
What if the lions are less cruel than you ? 
You can 't understand your cruelty .

Without Rayden , it 's hopeless . 
They 're your weakness . 
Pathetic and weak . 
Without your weapons ... you are no match for Motaro . 
I suppose I 'll die . 
I feel fear , anxiety , isolation and darkness . 
Even if we merge , what 's going to happen when i die ? 
I don 't give a shit about that . 
In the worst case . 
Could it explode by accident ? 
They covered his face as if he were dead . 
The bomb exploded two metres away from him . 
Or you 're a dead man ! 
I 'm terribly saddened ... 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
That man 's hatred ... is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
A society that hates the war . 
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
You 're in danger ? 
She would suffer too much . 
- A crime ? 
I 'II give the signaI to attack . 
He 'II get fuck- aIl .

Robbers and murderers play sabbath in front of the whole world . 
We 'II be doing so weII now that even Saakadze gets jealous . 
ShaII we attack them ? 
Don 't think I 'm blaming you . 
And if one day we 're in trouble ... 
You 're a stupid boy . 
Woe to you , and a buIlet in the head . 
Don 't you hurt this boy , you got me ? 
- Careful , you devil ! 
We must attack the prison . 
It is my burden and mine alone . 
Angela , for example , will die dead . 
You lose . 
I gotta say I 'm not loving it . 
You just ruined our wedding . 
'Cause she 's a bad influence on you , and she always has been . 
How painful it would be to run into one . 
And that Satan will try to discourage you . 
Watch out fag . 
When I was miserable ? 
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me ? 
I killed my son ! 
Bobby killed himself . 
Why are we wasting it on this ? 
Cease fire ! 
Kill me ! 
My brothers , we must not see only the threat . 
All the same , it will be dangerous . 
Then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ? 
No , no . 
No right , Bishop Courtenay , no right ? 
There is danger for you here . 
I 'll run but you 're in trouble if you 're late .

The worst of illiterates turn poets 
To seek and destroy .

I believe the situation is very bad . 
May evil be vanquished ! 
Look Sachin , it 's as dangerous for me as it is for you 
Bastards !

- Don 't worry about me , Ma 
You are not happy ? 
Colonel Ravi , this is the turning point of the war 
I don 't want to die . 
And what if we lose ? 
Don 't lose anything . 
There 's a price to be paid for every victory in war 
All you must think of is the enemy ! 
- But you attacked them , didn 't you ? 
One gun fire 
Death is staring him in the face and he 's thinking of his girl ! 
The bastards are sending for reinforcements ! 
My father can 't be wrong 
Bastard 
Bastards ! 
You can launch an attack on Khalubar now 
" that you will complain no more " 
No problems at all . 
Don 't worry . 
We even had some trouble finding your records . 
What the fuck ? 
No , no , no , just a second . 
That is more than all the casualties from all the wars fought ... 
I 'm gonna lose my job . 
I assume that Mr. Grieves got the colonoscopy . 
Mr. Grieves ' procedure was complicated by the fact that -- 
What 's wrong with my leg ?

We hate to see them go . 
You sang " trouble . " 
You know, that was the problem . 
Simon thought it was weak and weird and lacked impact . 
But the myth ignores the squalid reality of violent death . 
And the next day I go out and I steal double . 
He is , to all intents and purposes , dead long before that . 
- Wrong guy . 
We 've run out of the crude planks . 
People are living in poverty and misery . 
Moses needed to be killed .

You 're assaulting me ! 
I 'm broke . 
No , there 's no place for you to try it on . 
Are you scared we 'll be busted ? 
Are you scared of living a poor life ? 
The son- of- a- bitch ! 
Excuse my saying so but I think this is stupidity . 
Considering a couch an investment proves you 're a bad tradesman . 
I 'm tired . 
I didn 't say it was dishonest , honey ! 
You 're not very cheerful either . 
You went to a lot of trouble . 
I want to say something , but don 't get mad . 
Is anyone scared ? 
I swear we sell them for the price of dead sheep . 
And no harm is done to the historical object . 
Terribly hot .

And when we stop doing it , we 'll be dead . 
I 'm really feeling bad lately . 
Didn 't you catch a robber at that time ? 
Oh , the robber . 
I was the one who caught the robber . 
Being lead down an annoying path . 
It 's a fake thing .

Something inside of me didn 't think it was wrong . 
Damn it .

They covered his face as if he were dead . 
The bomb exploded two meters away from him . 
Don 't move , General , if you don 't want to die . 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
Hatred of that man is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
A society that hates this war . 
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
All right , I 'll have you arrested .

Don 't worry about Robin . 
- Bastard ! 
- He 's a lunatic and a felon . 
What the hell is wrong with you ? 
They fired him for stalking customers . 
The trouble with real life is , there 's no danger music . 
Poor child of mine . 
If it finds evil , it stops . 
See how they cry . 
What if the lions are less cruel than you ? 
You can 't understand your cruelty . 
And now you 're here , hurt , with no force left to fight ... 
You were going to kill that poor couple , why ? 
We will kill her . 
And your eyes turned bad ... ... and ugly .

She and her people have suffered a lot .

The prosecution lawyer may proceed . 
O coward ! 
But there is something I regret . 
I 'd hate to see that happen . 
I ' m going to be broke ! 
But you must fix my problem first . 
But this is nothing ... ... the war is yet to begin . 
He unleashed a storm on poor Geeta !

Your nose isn 't bloody radar ! 
Wouldn 't you be sad , Monique ? 
- Dirty old poof ! 
Don 't be so damn nasty , Antoine ! 
You 'll hurt his feelings . 
Poor people ... they risk their freedom to steal our boredom . 
You 'll be alone with your shame .

Of what was stolen from me ...

I wouldn 't worry about him . 
Negative . 
Something 's wrong . 
I hated her for that . 
What 's your problem ? 
- Did you call moi a dipshit ? 
John , it was stupid of you to go there . 
The data could be called " pain " . 
Chill out , dick- wad . 
- Skynet fights back . 
Why attack Russia ? 
Killing Dyson might prevent the war . 
Oh , shit . 
Shit ! 
Fuck you . 
Earth is under attack . 
You killed my older brother . 
What the hell have you done to yourself this time ? 
Damn it ! 
I 've seen worse , too . 
Without Rayden , it 's hopeless . 
They 're your weakness . 
Pathetic and weak . 
Without your weapons ... you are no match for Motaro . 
I suppose I 'll die . 
I feel fear , anxiety , isolation and darkness . 
Even if we merge , what 's going to happen when i die ? 
I don 't give a shit about that . 
In the worst case . 
Could it explode by accident ? 
They covered his face as if he were dead . 
The bomb exploded two metres away from him . 
Or you 're a dead man ! 
I 'm terribly saddened ... 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
That man 's hatred ... is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
A society that hates the war . 
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
You 're in danger ? 
She would suffer too much . 
- A crime ? 
I 'II give the signaI to attack . 
He 'II get fuck- aIl . 
May the mercifuI Lord punish me ! 
You know yourself that they 're honest people , but poor . 
May eviI and violence disappear . 
Robbers and murderers play sabbath in front of the whole world . 
We 'II be doing so weII now that even Saakadze gets jealous . 
ShaII we attack them ? 
Don 't think I 'm blaming you . 
And if one day we 're in trouble ... 
You 're a stupid boy . 
Woe to you , and a buIlet in the head . 
Don 't you hurt this boy , you got me ? 
- Careful , you devil ! 
We must attack the prison . 
It is my burden and mine alone . 
Angela , for example , will die dead . 
You lose . 
I gotta say I 'm not loving it . 
You just ruined our wedding . 
'Cause she 's a bad influence on you , and she always has been . 
How painful it would be to run into one . 
And that Satan will try to discourage you . 
Watch out fag . 
When I was miserable ? 
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me ? 
I killed my son ! 
Bobby killed himself . 
Why are we wasting it on this ? 
Cease fire ! 
Kill me ! 
My brothers , we must not see only the threat . 
All the same , it will be dangerous . 
Then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ? 
No , no . 
No right , Bishop Courtenay , no right ? 
There is danger for you here . 
I 'll run but you 're in trouble if you 're late . 
- The sinful .

What else can one steal here ? 
Deepak sir ... the enemy will now lie in coffins

There 's said to be some problem there 
I will avenge every death ! 
The worst of illiterates turn poets 
To seek and destroy . 
You 're dead right 
The enemy can 't be seen . 
I believe the situation is very bad . 
May evil be vanquished ! 
Look Sachin , it 's as dangerous for me as it is for you 
Bastards ! 
Don 't worry , Colonel . 
- Don 't worry about me , Ma 
You are not happy ? 
Colonel Ravi , this is the turning point of the war 
I don 't want to die . 
And what if we lose ? 
Don 't lose anything . 
There 's a price to be paid for every victory in war 
All you must think of is the enemy ! 
- But you attacked them , didn 't you ? 
One gun fire 
Death is staring him in the face and he 's thinking of his girl ! 
The bastards are sending for reinforcements ! 
My father can 't be wrong 
Bastard 
Bastards ! 
You can launch an attack on Khalubar now 
" that you will complain no more " 
No problems at all . 
Don 't worry . 
We even had some trouble finding your records . 
What the fuck ? 
No , no , no , just a second . 
That is more than all the casualties from all the wars fought ... 
I 'm gonna lose my job . 
I assume that Mr. Grieves got the colonoscopy . 
Mr. Grieves ' procedure was complicated by the fact that -- 
What 's wrong with my leg ? 
What the fuck were you thinking ? 
Not bad . 
Too bad we 're just colleagues . 
I say let 's be reckless 
- Our car broke down . 
# Left for dead # 
Do you want to know what happens when you die ? 
# So stay and spin and fail and fail # 
That dress is such a paiN .

It was really , really weak . 
Sorry . >> Wrong choice of song for me . 
I ain 't spending no more time wasted 
>> Going to hollywood ! >> I just want to make it really bad . 
We hate to see them go . 
You sang " trouble . " 
You know, that was the problem . 
Simon thought it was weak and weird and lacked impact . 
But the myth ignores the squalid reality of violent death . 
And the next day I go out and I steal double . 
He is , to all intents and purposes , dead long before that . 
- Wrong guy . 
We 've run out of the crude planks . 
People are living in poverty and misery . 
Moses needed to be killed . 
This is an outrage ! 
You 're miserable ? 
Bon voyage , scumbag . 
When I got back here , she was crying . 
Mr Drake was quite badly hurt . 
I shouldn 't be scared ? 
I felt so bad for them . 
We catch criminals . 
No problem , ma 'am . 
You jealous ? 
I haven 't got much bloody choice , have I ? 
You 're assaulting me ! 
I 'm broke . 
No , there 's no place for you to try it on . 
Are you scared we 'll be busted ? 
Are you scared of living a poor life ? 
The son- of- a- bitch ! 
Excuse my saying so but I think this is stupidity . 
Considering a couch an investment proves you 're a bad tradesman . 
I 'm tired . 
I didn 't say it was dishonest , honey ! 
You 're not very cheerful either . 
You went to a lot of trouble . 
I want to say something , but don 't get mad . 
Is anyone scared ? 
I swear we sell them for the price of dead sheep . 
And no harm is done to the historical object . 
Terribly hot . 
It 's not something to be sad about ... 
Go , get the weapons . 
Fuck ! 
Mom ... ... and if they kill you , what should I do ? 
Because they weren 't bad off . 
386 00 : 22 : 29, 191 -- > 00 : 22 : 31, 182 When to kazes , how ?

Are you scared ? 
He was deceived . 
Don 't shoot ! 
- This war confused my plans . 
Prisoners ! 
Almost all of you will die . 
You 'll all be killed . 
You scare off the customers . 
It 's destroying you . 
But to act on it is wrong . 
That 's gonna hurt tomorrow . 
Don 't ever fucking threaten me . 
Rules are made to be broken . 
L 'll lose my voice before opening night . 
You have always been a little crazy - but it seems to be worse . 
Come on , it 's not that great . 
Nobody panics .

Twice as useless ! 
- No one envies us any more . 
He wants to kill everybody ? 
Killing ! 
This is really cruel , Oskar . 
Nothing bad is going to happen to you there . 
Where 's the scam ? 
I could have you arrested . 
I am a criminal . 
She didn 't kill anyone ! 
We 've got no visitations , no phone calls . 
- Don 't worry , I think I 've got a plan . 
This is not my first time inside a prison . 
Fearfully blazing 
And he suffers from palsy That makes his paws shake 
And I once understudied Dick Whittington 's Cat 
But when a crime 's discovered Then Macavity 's not there

Even if we merge , what 's going to happen when i die ? 
I don 't give a shit about that . 
In the worst case . 
Could it explode by accident ? 
They covered his face as if he were dead . 
The bomb exploded two metres away from him . 
Or you 're a dead man ! 
I 'm terribly saddened ... 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
That man 's hatred ... is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
A society that hates the war . 
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
You 're in danger ? 
She would suffer too much . 
- A crime ?

How painful it would be to run into one . 
And that Satan will try to discourage you . 
Watch out fag . 
When I was miserable ? 
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me ? 
I killed my son ! 
Bobby killed himself . 
Why are we wasting it on this ? 
Cease fire !

My brothers , we must not see only the threat . 
All the same , it will be dangerous . 
Then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ?

No supper , no supper , no supper . 
I was poor .

Some go away ... ... others come to fish in troubled waters . 
Killing him doesn 't mean relieving the farmers . 
The magistrate 's office is guarded as if at war . 
It 'll be suicidal for them .

Now I got cats to worry about .

I had four , but two were killed and one is a prisoner . 
Bad habits take root with fearful rapidity ... 
A piano is a burden . 
I felt ashamed , thinking only of myself . 
It 's as dull as tombs over here . 
I tried to clean them , but it only made them look worse . 
I never heard of anything so horrid . 
Jo , don 't do anything rash . 
I 'd rather get scarlet fever and die than go to Aunt March 's . 
So desperately sorry .

We must prevent it because it is madness !

You 're looking terrible . 
You shouldn 't think the worst just because he 's a lieutenant . 
I 'm distressed myself , if Madam could pass in the afternoon . 
But if you make such a disorder , this is getting on my nerves . 
I 'm not at all interested in your stupid secret . 
This duel is madness . 
We must prevent this madness ! 
He 's dead . 
What would I be crying about ? 
Tell them we 're leaving because we don 't wanna be a burden . 
- You hurt me ? 
I hate the place . 
We were broke and I went out to beg for a few nickels . 
No , Eddie , no catch . 
Nonsense . 
I can 't be annoyed with jealous or moody men about me . 
The position is so ridiculous . 
Poor old Dobbin . 
So you resented it a little . 
Cracking your whip and making these poor fools jump around . 
Why , if you weren 't so pathetic , you 'd be funny . 
- Don 't worry , I 'm on my way . 
- It 's all about the Depression . 
I 'll make them laugh at you starving to death , honey . 
- That 's just the trouble . 
Don 't be stupid , Trixie . 
You have no right to hide such genius in a side- street museum . 
That 's too bad , sister . 
- You give me a pain . 
This mug with all the money has had two or three nasty affairs . 
No , I haven 't forgotten . 
Before this terrible thing happened to me ... 
Upon the conclusion of the American Civil War ... 
Its grim tragedy seems to fascinate everyone . 
A heavyset fellow , with a broken nose ? 
No trouble at all , my child . 
The old man was depressed at the opening last night . 
I have no desire to hurt you . 
- Now , Poison lvy , was that a story ?

Aren 'tyou ashamed ofyourselves ? . 
I 'm ashamed ofyou . 
You 're a bigger fool than I tookyou for . 
But I lost him long before he died . 
Just as darned fool as your reasons for behaving the wayyou did . 
It 's her fault we ain 't married . 
He needed a mother , poor boy , and you weren 't around . 
Aren 't you ashamed of yourselves ?

Don 't you suppose I 'm sorry for the harm he did ? 
It 's a dull life , Skipper . 
I 'm shattered . 
Well , he got in some trouble over losing his ship , I guess . 
He said you 'd be angry if I tried to make trouble . 
They 'd have answered those shots I fired if they 'd heard them . 
By morning she 'll be dead . 
I 'll be there if I don 't have that pain in my side again . 
But don 't have that pain that night . 
I 'm awful sick , and I 've been having the terriblest dreams .

Killing won 't bother me . 
I 'm ashamed of you , colleen . 
Oh , no , no , nothing like that . 
That 's why I 've gotta go up to the death house tonight . 
The rest of the prison knows nothing about this . 
My throat is so sore I can hardly speak . 
A bunch of violets , he had the wrong number .

If she thought you stole 'em , it would break her poor old heart . 
He 's dead . 
Don 't give me that dirty one . 
If I wasn 't so busy , I 'd go over and choke that guy to death . 
Little devils . 
You scared , Roger ? 
When you can no longer bear the pain , take one of these . 
Pain , agony , continual torture . 
Long hours , short wages , steam , sweat , consumption , slavery . 
Oh , forget that maniac . 
- You 're a liar . 
- Poor people .

Lying will get you nowhere ! , 
A young prosecutor ? , Another young fool . 
I have no regrets dying now ! 
I may have stolen some money , but I 'm no murderer , 
Men are mortal , we must die , But a name is forever , 
What if he saw you lie and send another to his death ? , 
He grabbed me and threw me down , He was going to rape me again ! 
The enemy began retreating . 
Terribly hungry .

3 men and 1 woman trapped in a building . 
Here , there 's no time to worry 
It 's a disgrace . 
But today , now that I 'm dead , 
I 'm going to bed , I 'm tired . 
The trouble I have with that boy ... 
- Bad nerves . 
But they 're castles , robber barons used to Iive there . 
You know I can 't bear to see you cry . 
You have no idea , Miss Stumm , what plans I had for you !

Was she guilty , do you think ? 
A gun will be fired from the tower , Your Majesty . 
Liar .

Not even hatred . 
Maybe I asked in the wrong way . 
Why don 't you worry more about yourself ? 
I 'm dying a lonely , miserable death on a rainy night . 
That 's too bad . 
That 's nonsense . 
No , no . 
Coffee before I murder you . 
I 've got to broadcast , and I 'm so darned tired now . 
While you were touring China , she went through hell ! 
I got sick of being Sally Trent , so I switched to Mimi Benton . 
That having failed , at least you could have cabled me . 
For all you know , she may even be dead . 
Are you going in search of that dreadful woman ? 
No lies , please . 
Only fools . 
A man will not find peace who robs his heirs . 
I will come back to kill . 
Heart failure . 
When your master died , Laing ... 
Somebody attacked me , and snatched my bag . 
- You might do worse . 
What a horrible house . 
We all know that dead men don 't come back . 
I 'm sorry to disturb you . 
You don 't think I hate you , do you ? 
You never did have a great deal of sense . 
Do dead men walk ? 
I 'm sorry I was offensive . 
Just a dirty crook . 
If either of you two horrible men so much as move ... in it goes . 
You idiot ! 
If there are any hysterics to be had , I 'll have them . 
I got a weak heart . 
Dead men tell no tales . "

Most poisons would be completely burned off by cremation 
I was out sick that day . 
All these bad things just happen . 
My husband 's dead . 
It explains away his bad breath . 
- You 're always sad . 
- You 're always sad . 
I have never seen you so agitated . 
He might even be dead by now . 
I 've seen worse than this . 
What is the problem ? 
The secret phrase is " last night 's prisoners . " 
No , this will make things difficult . 
Bring me Felipe Martinez , one of the prisoners . 
Don 't be frightened . 
No , no , no .

That would make Kikue very jealous . 
Don 't worry . 
In a sad endless farewell 
You think you 're a big lady- killer , don 't you ? 
Mr. Caetano , don 't get mad at the girl . 
You 're right , he 's an ass . 
Get me out of this mess . 
D. José 's horse is sick ? 
Stealing my hat ! 
There 's some misunderstanding here . 
It 's a liver problem .

" Namida no Wataridori ( Crying Vagabond ) " Lyrics by Yaso Saijô 
However , when my father had financial troubles , you ran away . 
You are too selfish . 
I would like to have seen the bully defeated . 
Why should I worry ? 
There is so much injustice 
His punishment will be unimaginable 
No , Tahar , leave me ! 
You noisy idiot – what are you doing ? 
We killed him ! 
You weep 
That is your burden to suffer 
I want to show her a spectacle of terror 
Tahar ; we don 't want you to die . 
There 's no time to lose ! 
Nasty , low , vulgar things ! 
Our Charles sure beat the hell outta them ! 
Oh my poor girl ... 
And it 's poison to my rhumatism . 
Are you NUTS ? 
And why did you kill those poor hares ? 
Oh what a circus , my poor Mr Podoletz ! 
I am not rich , 
Come now , I didn 't mean to insult you . 
No no , don 't take your pants off 
I 'll get mad if I want to . 
- Imbecile ! 
- A thief and a prostitute ! 
Oh to hell with her , all she has is her dowry and her cafe ... 
Bankers are stealing money . 
What a liar ! 
No , no , don 't tell me . 
And I 've never loved . 
Was Valentine really deceived ? 
Damned coward ! 
Your heart is beating too loudly , Dulcie . 
I 'd die . 
What an awful taste . 
- In this moment just an idiot . 
But also sad . 
I am not a great appreciator of monuments . 
- No , no ! 
Have I ever been wrong ? 
Darn shame . 
You 've never been so insulted in your life . 
Not bad at all . 
Don 't you worry .

I brought her back so much perfume she used to stink with it . 
A blind man ? 
It 'll get you into trouble .

You 're an anarchist , a menace to society . 
Destruction of everything I worked for . 
You look 'horrible . 
- Don 't worry , it 's all worked out . 
The only guy that suspects Ian Hamilton is Ian Hamilton ! 
Don 't worry , sooner or later Ryo will understand you . 
- No , no , I 'll wait . 
Come into my office and tell me your troubles . 
I suppose I shall never be wonderful , not wonderful like them .

To serve a sundae without a cherry is simply stupidity itself . 
Just too terrible . 
I 'm terribly sorry , Your Highness . 
I 'm going to weep . 
It isn 't a rotten loan . 
- No , I can stop now . 
If my patients were like you , I 'd starve to death . 
In the meantime , have no fears . 
You saw the tragic state she was in . 
" Men are selfish brutes . " 
Have you quite finished insulting me ? 
And there are those who think it isn 't such bad poetry . 
It isn 't pa 's fault , I suppose . 
I proposed and I thought it would be so difficult . 
I mean stupid , thickheaded , idiotic . 
Oh , no , Miss Ba . 
Terribly . 
Because at heart I 'm as vain as a peacock . 
By a failure you mean an attempt . 
And always failing . 
Was it as bad as all that ? 
See Naples and die ... 
No , no , Harry . 
Oh , what if disaster came to you through me ? 
You mustn 't say such things or they 'll hate me . 
I know I 've deceived you , I 'm sorry . 
Once again I feel tired and start coughing . 
Don 't be fool ! 
I was tired of travelling ... 
Not so bad but very stubborn . 
Not , I 'm sad to say . 
No , no , it really isn 't so tragic . 
Have you ever seen anything quite as mad as that Rexford girl ? 
Shocking ! 
What 's wrong with it ? 
I was wrong . 
From your standpoint you weren 't wrong , I guess . 
You 're mad . 
You might have been killed , I suppose you know that . 
He 's quite mad and ... 
It opened my eyes to something inside of me that frightened me . 
I 'm not so sure of myself anymore , and I 'm so sure of you . 
We 've failed . 
You can detain and control lives with words and divorces ... 
It was dead and it 's gonna stay dead . 
You might regret this , Lady Rexford . 
- Don 't worry . 
- They broke it again ? 
Was his wife angry , wasn 't she ? 
- Don 't worry . 
Cheap ones are bad . 
Don 't scold her , as she dare to come . 
You make me a fool . 
Too bad for you . 
You annoy me . 
Once failed , no more chance . 
Don 't worry . 
- It 's bad enough having to feed him . 
A criminal ? 
Twice with the same partner - how sinful ! 
" Madame , no need to worry . 
Don 't worry . 
You 're a stupid girl . 
Coward ! 
But I beg you , don 't send me to prison ! 
Don 't worry , Fantine . 
The poor girl had never been dancing . 
I 'd hate going for water in the dark . 
They crushed the Revolution of 1830 . 
But the fool thought I was tending to him . 
Damn ! 
Our folks are hopeless . 
This is an outrage , sir .

This is an outrage , sir . 
We 're going to get killed . 
Ah , you 're thinking they could attack our flank ? 
- Not going to kill me now ? 
They wouldn 't let me through , so I disguised myself . 
But you 'd be angry later when we met again . 
He went off to get himself killed just to spite me . 
I 'm your prisoner now . 
And that idiot Basque acted so mysterious . 
Don 't cry . 
Frankly speaking , it was a nasty wake- up . 
The darkest thoughts occurred to them . 
Frankly speaking , it was a nasty wake- up .

You want war ? 
Don 't be disappointed . 
I know I 'm being rather selfish , 
But I was thoughtless , too . 
I was wrong . 
There 's another one over there who hates to go home . 
What a selfish way of talking ! 
I did nothing but make you suffer . 
What harm ? 
Why poor ? 
No , no ! 
- No , no ! 
I am a poor old man ! 
You 're under arrest ! 
- The prisoners ... do we hang them ? 
Yes , they arrested him and his wife was in despair . 
Light up the coward ! 
- The horror ! 
What bad thoughts ! 
You are obnoxious , and tomorrow I will have you hanged . 
Carmela , from now on I want to be jealous . 
- He 's a fake . 
I hated to wake you up . 
Don 't be a sucker . 
I 'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night . 
" Betrayed by a maid in her teens

And don 't worry , I 'm protecting you , son ... 
Oh , don 't let that worry you . 
" In vain , oh woman , I long to find you . " 
It 's useless , you know ? 
But you are ... you 're tired ! 
# I told my heart not to love , # I told my heart not ... # 
It 's painful , I know . 
" but fight for her . 
Rather , keep left , on the bad side of the road . 
She says that if I don 't go back immediately , I 'm fired . 
Now listen to me you dirty , big , black , snake in the bush . 
Schnarzan will be furious . 
No melancholy day 
That dirty such and such and so and so and this and that ... 
I know , but he said no more tonight . 
And then Anatole was a dead cat . 
A bomb ? 
Horribly . 
The criminal code . 
You 've no business to think I 'm wrong . 
- Nonsense ! 
Who said this frock was bad ? 
Dirty little cheat . 
- No , no , no . 
He 's unstable , moody , dangerous and bad . 
It 's a terribly difficult case . 
He 's jealous . 
- Very bad . 
No , no , no . 
We have to fight or die . 
Fail ? 
- You 're a fool , Pearson . 
First time I ever saw her cry . 
- And then I 'll die . 
Look at it out there , mocking us . 
What does the war mean to them ? 
- You 're a fool , Pearson . 
First time I ever saw her cry . 
Take that turn of mine before the war . 
- And then I 'll die . 
Look at it out there , mocking us . 
What does the war mean to them ? 
Did you experience similar problems ? 
STAY HERE STOP LEAVE THlS EVENlNG ON YACHT STOP 
- Are they annoying you ? 
I 'm tired . 
She is in danger . 
You 've never looked more beautiful than this evening . 
Contempt for contempt . 
Is she ill ? 
Exactly a year before he died . 
It 's useless , no matter what you say . 
Let him go on thinking his father is dead . 
Who do you think got you out of trouble back then ? 
This is terrible . 
You think I 'm jealous ? 
We 've broken up . 
The impresario tried to help me out , but it was aII in vain . 
Let him go on thinking his father is dead . 
Who do you think got you out of trouble back then ? 
You 'll make a fine emperor someday , you idiot ! 
- War with Finland ? 
But , Marie , that 's wicked .

That’ s why the others are jealous . 
I 've always hated it . 
Stop this nonsense ! 
When he puts his arm around you , you 're troubles are over . 
The shock 'll kill him . – Any ideas ? – A hand full of them . 
No , no , I couldn 't do that .

Now we 're going to teach little Mary Jo how to scream . 
And the scream , was it all right ? 
It frightens me . 
I 've thrown her out of my theater like a dead rat . 
- A little on the sad side , isn 't it ? 
Now don 't interrupt us , no matter what happens . 
You nearly caused a panic among the passengers . 
This whole thing is so humiliating to me . 
Every minute with every breath , lying to me . 
Lying to me . 
I 'm a fake ? 
Don 't worry . 
Why not have Judas drink the poison that was intended for me ? 
Laughing at them , so cruel , so terrible . 
You 're a scream . 
I 've had enough of your lies . 
- A lunatic ? 
O. J. , I 'm in no mood for a lot of fuzzy lamentations . 
Goodbye ... pale messenger of death . 
Why did you do this terrible thing ? 
It wasn 't your fault . 
She stayed behind when he died up there . 
Strange instinct that leads elephants to one spot to die . 
Kill one , and we 'll have to kill all . 
Don 't forget , Martin , there are dangers in the jungle , too . 
You 're a bad boy . 
Afraid we 'll lose our direction . 
- Dead men can 't give orders . 
I realize we 're violating something he holds sacred . 
Don ? t think of refusing a toast . 
His father is dead . 
It 's an outrage . 
That 's bad . 
Let 's fool them .

What a waste to have that pot without knowing its secret .

It 's cruel to make a hungry child cry ! 
There was no choice , but it 's sad . 
You 're such a bad boy . 
When I say no , I mean no ! 
Oh , my head hurts ! 
Shall I report the head is ill , so the contest must be delayed ? 
It will offend our ancestors if that hooligan leaves in this way . 
You re a fool not to know your place ! 
Your skill is wasted . 
No problem . 
- You poor child . 
He just insulted me , that 's all . 
You lose this one time , son .

I was angry because you had given us so much money . 
A jealous man is no more dangerous than a blind bull . 
- She has a temper , as you probably know . 
Poor Pascual ! 
And poor little Concha . 
I 've broken so many hearts . 
That shot was an accident . 
- You never loved me or you couldn 't do this . 
Go and kill the only man I 've ever cared for !

Damn ! 
Our folks are hopeless . 
This is an outrage , sir . 
We 're going to get killed . 
Ah , you 're thinking they could attack our flank ? 
- Not going to kill me now ? 
They wouldn 't let me through , so I disguised myself . 
But you 'd be angry later when we met again . 
He went off to get himself killed just to spite me .

Stupid , if you ask me . 
Says he 's broke . 
Never fails . 
Otherwise it 's stealing . 
Oh , my poor boy . 
Take your dirty work to somebody else . 
We traced the license , but it was stolen . 
- You 've lost that purple angry look . 
You used the same gun to kill that bank guard . 
- Nonsense . 
They 're not playing with a bunch of helpless bank tellers . 
Now , you mustn 't worry about that . 
And if they try to stop me , I 'll dump her into their laps .

You rather both starve ? 
A devil of a woman ! 
Sad that you 're leaving . 
I 'm going to rob a bank . 
He knows who committed the murder . 
Bring the prisoner in . 
I doubt very much that Napoleon murdered this pawnbroker . 
That was the morning after the murder , wasn 't it ? 
I 'm afraid it 's in the possession of the murderer . 
And you were starving . 
If you have a case against me arrest me ! 
Let his mind be addressed , let this conscience be his prison . 
He 's in trouble . What is it ? 
It 's no sin to destroy an ugly thing like a ... black beetle . 
Because you 've taken your sin on yourself . 
Watch fear . 
¿ Arrested ? 
They want to condemn it to death . 
He would destroy the Temple . 
He deserves death . 
Resurrected dead . 
No , no , do appear to hell . 
Come on , proves them wrong .

Otherwise you 'll be unhappy your entire life .. 
How could you be so cruel to him ? 
It is a goddamn mermaid , isn 't it ? 
I 'm going to hell . 
I have a bad feeling about this , Angus . 
I 've had men flogged to death for less . 
We made a mistake , no harm done . 
Oh , I have a problem . 
- Prisoners don 't get to read ? 
What 's your problem ? 
This is all my fault . 
What 's wrong ? 
What 's wrong ? 
What a bastard ! 
News of the battle frightened me . 
I just want to go somewhere where there are no bad people . 
An escaped prisoner ? 
I 'm thinking our victim was lured here ... ... then murdered . 
She 's stealing a number of items in a variety of sizes . 
You got nothing to do with the murder , 
Dad 's gonna be very disappointed . 
And just maybe he took a bullet for catching a thief ... 
Murder charges have been dropped . 
They 're using you as a scapegoat for her client . 
I think they really might kill each other this time . 
This is the third murder they 've been connected to today . 
Got a bloody knife . 
- No , no . 
Well , I guess there 's no harm in that . 
You mean worry about appearances , or me ?

O- Ren often used to sit here and cry . 
She was on the brink of going bad herself . 
What’ s wrong ? 
No , no , we can’ t do that . 
It’ s too bad she couldn’ t come . 
Oh , my poor shoes and stockings . 
That 's not a name , it 's a catastrophe . 
I lose nothing . 
Your delivery boy 's still sick ? 
What a bitch . 
I don 't want to risk it today , with everyone so nervous .

Before attacking Justin , Esposito is going after the others . 
- Those poor sick men ! 
Your hurting my ears with your stuttering ! 
Poor fool ! 
You 're mad because you think he didn 't pay you enough ! 
That 's awful to die so far from home .

I 've never been so humiliated in all my life . 
Madam , with those few words , you have broken my heart .

My poor old mother used to get these dizzy spells . 
It 's Humbolt , he 's driving me crazy ! 
Now I am getting angry . 
Don 't you worry . 
Really and truly kill each other ? 
- They 's liable to hurt you . 
Every time I see you you 're always so tired . 
- As if that weren 't bad enough . 
If you find any of them guilty , give them five lashes each . 
- Sick ? 
She was sick for three weeks and gettin ' worse . 
Never complain about nothing and always cheerful . 
Mother isn 't going to be sick much longer now . 
War 's full of chances . 
Her old man 's the most dangerous scout in the rebel army . 
Oh , no , no , child . 
Don 't cry . 
You mustn 't cry . 
All your terrible fears are over . 
How rude ! 
I got rid of our burden . 
Tonight makes me worry all the more . 
Poor Mother . 
If this goes on , he 'il be ruined . 
Father 's tired , so he 's coming home early . 
I got out and followed , but I lost him . 
You stupid … 
Fool .

Lies ! 
This doesn’ t seem bad . 
Perhaps , you want to [ scare ] me , too ! 
We 're defeated . 
Why are you in such a bad mood , Fred ? 
Nonsense . 
Am I disturbing ?

He 's a bad man 
He 's a wicked man 
He 's the wrong man 
He 's the wrong man 
He 's a bad man 
And if you lose , you marry me . 
It 'd be all right if they wouldn 't scare him . 
I 'm afraid she 's rather crude oil . 
You 're a dangerous woman . 
Don 't worry . 
You 're suggesting I 'm your enemy ? 
Don 't disturb her , Rand . 
I suppose I have myself to blame for losing you . 
Do you know you might have killed me ? 
How terrible . 
Why you , low- down , sneaky ... 
You know committing perjury is a major sin , heavily punished . 
She 's scared of losing her lawsuit . 
Shut up , idiot . 
If those 2 don 't get married , it 's your fault . 
He 's not too happy . 
Are we treating you that bad ? 
Don 't worry . 
Don 't worry . 
Don 't worry . 
But in her inhumane chest there 's cruelty and lies . 
It may be bigger , but not nicer . 
Even if I have to kill someone ! 
This crueI silence hurts me so . 
Maybe it 's my fault . 
Don 't worry , leave it to me . 
Actually , one thief . 
Mr Argüelles didn 't shoot ... the poor , hungry man again . 
Don 't panic , Burgundy . 
Repent of your sins . 
Many are dead . 
That arrogant person will end badly , I tell you . 
I will not tolerate it if you insult my king . 
But you 're vain , Joan . 
She 's kept prisoner in Rouen and has been sentenced to death . 
You 're such a fool .

He 's a liar . 
Don 't worry . 
Then you got nothin ' to worry about , son . 
I 'm practically starved . 
- Maybe I 'm wrong . 
- You 're just achin ' to stir up some trouble , aren 't ya ? 
I 'm the one to name the weapons . 
He 's a liar . 
Don 't worry . 
I 'll bet it 's all a fake . 
- Oh , that 's bad . 
- Very tragic about poor Sheppard , wasn 't it ? 
Lose a lot of those balls . 
Poor Teddy . 
- This has become very annoying . 
I 'm so ashamed . 
A place where you 're not , Julia ... is hell for me . 
I can 't stand your terrible silence any longer ! 
You 'll be unhappy .

What 's done is done , don 't be sad 
Sister , don 't cry 
I was promised promotion after I 've killed Su Song

Do you really have to die ?

I 'm going to fool you this time . 
Don 't worry , I 'm checking out of this hotel for keeps . 
If they were , these places would be haunted houses . 
To tell you how much I hated you . 
I know I was wrong , Mr. Williams , and I 'm sorry . 
Let him die , without a fight ? 
A guy who poisoned three of his customers . 
You 're just begging for the isolation cell , aren 't you ? 
Get Taylor and shoot to kill .

Poor nothing . 
It would hurt . 
We 're going to the thieves market . 
To be able to forgive a man his sins , and not his virtues . 
And the House of Tudor has sins . 
Whose power frightens only the ladies . 
You 've just begged yourself a skinful of broken bones this time . 
In the past ... you have jealously kept my bounty to yourselves . 
And that to ever again become Tom Canty ... is to die . 
Cheating at cards means associating with dull people . 
- My dad 's dead . 
And got ill on the Steward of the Household .

- My dad 's dead . 
And got ill on the Steward of the Household . 
If he stopped so suddenly , don 't you know how to stop too ! 
I want to report a crime . 
Don 't worry about me ! 
I 'd be lying if I said I wasn 't afraid . 
Don 't worry , I 'll punish them . 
Gaga , if you tell on me , I 'll be a dead man . 
You think that we 've made up , bastard ! 
You bastard ! 
- I think he must be mad ! 
Give me a gun ! 
The court will decide whether you should die or not ! 
It 's useless . 
Don 't push me , otherwise I 'll kill the hostage . 
It 's so itchy ... so itchy ... 
I prefer cutting my arm to losing me face in front of you . 
I hate you for the rest of my life ! 
Attack ! 
Lotus is so poor then . 
Shit ! 
Shit ... 
If I don 't keep my words , I 'll be punished by law . 
Foon said that I am merciless and selfish . 
I 've followed him for decades , he treats me badly too . 
People will die sooner or later ! 
What do you think the cause of Chun 's death ? 
And then torture them , make them confess . 
Your dad died , and you don 't even shed a tear . 
You , murderer ! 
To hell with you ! 
No , you are fooling me ! 
Before killing him , I went ... 
And I will be a criminal forever . 
One should be punished if he killed . 
But I dare to open my eyes to see what 's right and wrong . 
The penalty has been carried out . 
What sort of trouble ? 
But if we don 't agree they 're going to kill and loot the village 
We have done wrong in the village 
You 've now become his enemy 
I 'll come once I 've defeated the bandits 
You idiot 
No , no , or I 'll be drunk 
Many swordsmen have died 
A corpse contaminates the ground 
An insignificant effort unworthy of mentioning 
When you kill a living person with a sword 
Rarely leave our worries 
Does it mean you have seen the dead resurrected ? 
I can smell your poverty 
Really killed herself ? 
She committed suicide 
Would you rather kill that bastard 
Would you regret one day 
It 's a pity you have ruined it 
Murderers and rapists 
He is exhausted ! 
Someone standing on a bench , shivering like hell 
I 've stepped on your injured foot ! 
You 've broken my Master 's rib bones 
You 're okay , but , not good enough ! 
Gather your power and attack at short range 
Not bad ? 
See , it 's more broken than a broken body ! 
If they keep on causing trouble 
Don 't come if you 're broke 
Master is angry ! 
As long as we can get rid of the Three Devils 
And keep you here , you 'd have starved to death 
Stupid ! 
I heard Master has been sick 
Don 't you know that dad is sick ? 
Why did you kill him ? 
He 's got bad breath . 
It 's all my fault . 
- That wasn 't much of an illness anyway . 
No problem . 
Why such a temper this time ? 
Don 't be sad , Xiao Yun . 
He 's got bad breath . 
It 's all my fault .

Had I not taken his money , he would have felt insulted 
So difficult 
I am dead ! 
Don 't worry . 
Don 't worry , just remember to call Mommy together 
Something worse happens 
I already knew she had a fatal disease 
No perseverance then you are doomed to lose 
Don 't be angry at him anymore 
Have you been fooling me , you little rascal ? 
- Not bad . 
Oh , boy , what 's wrong with you ? 
Lucy , I 've caused you enough trouble for one day . 
Patsy will be disappointed .

- Wasn 't he dead ? 
What curse ! 
They 'll blame it on me ! 
Too bad you weren 't in the army . 
Prison will finish the job of making him a criminal . 
Trouble was I retired so long , I got out of practice . 
Don 't you worry about him . 
If a real riot breaks out in this place , 
You had plenty of trouble when you first come in . 
Button it up , you guys , I 'm tired . 
It 's been all over the prison for weeks . 
He must be mad . 
It 's very dangerous to rest all of a sudden . 
I can be just as stubborn as you are . 
Oh , you can 't lose a bad penny like me , you know . 
It 's very dangerous to rest all of a sudden . 
I get- a sick and tired of hearing that song over and over again !

Hey , that 's the new kid moved on the block , ain 't it ? 
You weren 't such a bad kid . 
And he starts beating me old lady . 
I want that boy caught and arrested . 
He wasn 't such a bad kid either , at first . 
Are you hurt bad ? 
Boy , he wasn 't scared of nobody . 
So she can take the rap for you every time you get in trouble ? 
To kill somebody this time ? 
And there I 'd be willing to die

But suppose the fish are color- blind ? 
I 'll see you later , Dick . 
I demand his arrest ! 
Life in danger while device in your possession . 
Then no wonder you weren 't worried when Hopkins got away . 
A dragnet is closing in on every known criminal hideout . 
Notify all cars to converge on Area " D , " Block 21 .

No , that 's the bad part about Bolshevism . 
I want no sense , no logic , no reason . 
- Not since the war . 
- Oh , how stupid of me . 
Complaining wives are such a bore . 
You 're jealous . 
You stepped on my toes and you ruined my shoes . 
- Not a bad idea . 
There 's always the danger of one 's becoming blasé .

I wouldn 't deceive anybody . 
Bad mistake . 
He hates you . 
- Troubled ? 
It 's always my unpleasant task to be the reminder of duty . 
You see ... ... l 've never been in love before . 
It 'll be a pity if we never get the chance . 
And now he 's alone in that devil 's castle . 
Why don 't you let me kill you quiet ? 
My only hurt is the thought of the pain I 've caused you . 
An awful lot of it . 
You worry about me ? 
Eugene , don 't be angry at what I 'm going to say . 
And I commit suicide . 
You will drown . 
There is no sacrifice too great , no humiliation too humiliating .

Have you been nagging her again ? 
Let 's have your name and get ready to die ! 
Every night I drown myself in sorrow over you 
Outrageous ! 
Where does it hurt ? 
But he 's always beating you When is he going to stop ? 
You 've been mad at me ever since I brought Mimi home 
The more difficult things are the more necessary you overcome them 
Are you blind ? 
Without you , it 's meaningless even if I became emperor 
You almost killed yourself , didn 't you ? 
Things are bad . 
I feel so tired 
Don 't worry . 
The Guilty Son of Sixth Brother 
This is outrageous ! 
That 's too bad . 
- Fresh kill ? 
You 're killing me . 
- I hear yours isn 't so bad , either . 
I 'm tired of buying dinners for younger men . 
They never give up their lives for the wrong people . 
49, 500 of them are wrong . 
I think it was stupid not to let people know . 
It goes with that " tired little boy " routine . 
- Why play with fire just to spite Linda ? 
It would be awful . 
You can 't cry over that . 
Don 't worry about a thing . 
And I feel terrible . 
She hasn 't harmed anyone . 
I place them here in memory of something that has died . 
If you think I 'm so terrible , why did you hire me for the part ? 
I 'll poison your soup . 
You haven 't a thing to worry about . 
I place them here in memory of something that has died . 
- I 'm completely discouraged .

Fujio is tired of waiting 
You worry too much 
I see , but it sounds dangerous 
Are they dirty ? 
Is arithmetic so difficult ? 
I 've been worried sick ! 
And she 's taken it the wrong way 
I was very rude

Okada came out worst of all 
Not really ... no !

You must be mad , don 't you remember who I am ? 
Horribly rough

No , you 're the wrong built . 
It 's this frightful party , I 'm having an awful job ! 
But it must be awfully difficult to strike the right note 
I tell you it 's a matter of life and death ! 
You find a clue and follow it to death 
And if you stopped chasing him he might find the real murderer 
He couldn 't kill anything ! 
You still insist on shielding a man wanted for murder 
Then whoever killed her ... 
A liar !

Mr. Morris , do you know who broke your window ? 
But you didn 't really see Tommy steal the salami , did you ?

I 'd always be with Tom Dillard 's son , right or wrong .

I never did him that bad . 
My zing , Miss Julie , you all dressed up for a hog killing ? 
Then I 'm sorry I troubled you . 
I 'm in fear and trembling she 'll break her neck . 
It was dreadful . 
It 's mighty bad in the city , mighty bad . 
- Frightening ? 
Pres , what fools we were . 
Miss Julie , I thought we 'd lost you .

Miss Julie , you 're looking mighty worn- out . 
I 'm terribly sorry . 
And so wicked . 
And I shall lose this necklace if I can 't produce a Russian . 
Oh , he doubts me , doubts me . 
Why , Philippe , you 're jealous . 
Little people with a terribly big task . 
Your presumption is criminal . 
If you should lose it ... 
I 'm sorry I 'm such a coward . 
Shoot to kill . 
If we failed , if we were taken ...

Nick 's no sucker . 
But it would hurt Linda 's feelings if I bet against Steele . 
Bill Steele 's got this fight in the bag already . 
- Don 't worry . 
You 're wrong , Sammy . 
The collodion shows no trace of poison . 
So I killed Stanton for the pleasure of losing a bet . 
What motive could Connors have in killing his own fighter ? 
You might regret it . 
Wait till tonight to knock his block off . 
I plead guilty , Mr. Crowder . 
- That 's the murder gun . 
Here you be , but remember — no tricks . 
I can 't stand to see Bill hurt — in the ring or out of it .

Death didn 't scare me , as you think . 
- Killing your bugs . 
Bugs or no bugs , this room 's making me sick . 
You think I 'm intimidated ? 
You wanted to get away , in spite of yourself . 
What a killer ... 
It was worse . 
- Are you angry ? 
He means as badly off .

- We 're doomed . 
- You 'd think he was dead .

In spite of her voices she was flammable and died of it ; 
Gossip is sinful . 
Poor dear , she was too tired . 
Who told you such nonsense ? 
If you 've lost your horse , I 'll pay it to you . 
He takes things too tragically . 
Your wife left you by a strange error . 
And every day I shall give 5 kilograms to the poor 
We were enemies . 
She isn 't ill or dead . 
You may slip and drown ! 
Is he making her cry ? 
Don 't do that , it 's dirty , you 'll get it infected . 
Don 't worry . 
I 'll wash over there ... you 're getting the water dirty . 
Too bad the mud 'll cover it . 
What are you , stupid ? 
Look , this is the cemetery , they 're dancing on their dead . 
I do not see this big fool for years ! 
You should be ashamed ! 
It 's too dangerous . 
I fear you are not big .

They 'll be going soon , no doubt . 
Worth the miserable lives of a hundred rum- rotten sailors . 
You must be tired . 
A smuggler and a cut- throat , I think you said . 
Never you fear . 
They 'd have murdered him . 
Poor thing .

What kind of trouble ? 
I mean , that 's too bad . 
Don 't worry about me . 
Savages may shout and holler 
You 're dangerous 
Oh , you 're dangerous 
You 're a riot . 
See what a fool you are ?

Murderers . 
Why would he be in trouble ?

There 's no inconvenience at all . 
It says there he 's dead . 
A killer . 
Don 't you worry about that . 
In a few minutes , you and I and Hansel will die . 
Even dead ! 
Miss Ellis , you look tired .

Are you really so heartless ? 
No , no I couldn 't . 
They were inadequate .

- And it is not my mind that is troubled . 
John Paul Jones , don 't you hate people who do that ? 
I 'm afraid this is dull for Irena . 
I phoned you because I 'm troubled . 
And they can fool the doctor sometimes . 
You are that close to real insanity .

Emergency beacon ! 
We can scream and scare it away , okay ? 
I think we scared it away , you know ? 
They might keep us from getting killed . 
An animal that was harming no one . 
He 's dead . 
I don 't want you to be sad . 
I know I 'm not beautiful . 
You 're harsh , Renaud . 
And him , over there , all alone so sad and forlorn 
Why is she ugly ? 
I don 't want you to be sad tonight . 
- I don 't believe in the Devil . 
What 's the harm ? 
Frighten me ... hit me ... kill me ... cut my throat ... 
Are we not happy ? 
The Devil pays the way . 
It would be a shame to disturb her dreams . 
I feel so alone , so helpless . 
My taste for life abandoned me with my wife 's death . 
Don 't be so glum . 
This hunt is so sad . 
Just poor stories concocted by the Devil to distract himself . 
You will see me as I am ... pitiful ... and alone . 
I belong to the Devil . 
I 'm even more lost , alone , and hopeless . 
Which is rather unpleasant . 
I am the Devil . 
- Jealous ? 
- Real weapons ! 
Gilles is no longer unhappy . 
Have no fear . 
The world 's misery , for example . 
You don 't want me to cry ? 
You 're wrong . 
I bear no ill will . 
The silence of death . 
- They 're fighting to the death , I 'm sure . 
Have no fear . 
Yet whatever I might have done wrong was unintentional . 
I was afraid to lose you . 
How could I ask you to abandon everything for me ? 
She 's mocking me . 
I also understand her sadness .

Sick ? 
Well , that is , nothing except an attempted assassination . 
All the time much trouble .

Much trouble . 
If Durand isn 't arrested in 4 days , I 'll beat you up ! 
You 're barking up the wrong tree . 
Mila , why are you being so nasty ? 
Will you think of me when you 're dead ? 
It 's Mrs. Point 's fault . 
No one ever returns from hell . 
Not many men would risk their career for an unhappy woman . 
I 'm sorry , wrong room . 
I 'd have him kill for money . 
Excuse me , Professor , but that 's not funny . 
Tragedy will strike tonight . 
The victim was stabbed with a lancet from this case . 
You were arrested 4 years ago in Marseille . 
I 'd only disappoint you if I stayed . 
Sorry officer , he 's a bit drunk . 
You already killed someone in a builder 's yard . 
You 're artists in crime . 
We can offer you your choice of death . 
To be killed by none of you , and arrest all three of you . 
It 's Iike sewing on buttons or beating an egg . 
I was caIled here on a serious emergency . 
Not bad . 
A boy is so much Iess Iikely to get into trouble than a girl . 
Never mind what he hates , get him . 
A bad influence for ... ? 
This 'II put the war back on page 1 0 ! 
If he ever starts talking about rabbits , you run Iike mad ! 
Isn 't that the wrong key ? 
Butch is sick ? 
Mary Lou , stop crying and teII me what hospital . 
Corey , I know you 're scared . 
I was called here on a serious emergency . 
Not bad . 
A boy is so much less likely to get into trouble than a girl . 
Marry somebody with money and kill two birds with one ceremony . 
Never mind what he hates , get him .

This 'll put the war back on page 10 !

Don 't worry about it . 
- Hello , Dick . 
Suppose your parents are unhappy . 
I just dumped my bags and rushed right over here . 
Oh , come , mustn 't be bitter just because ... 
- Stop this nonsense , Maggie . 
No bad news , I hope . 
- I never believed she loved him . 
- No , leave her alone . 
Anybody but that awful boy . 
- No , no . 
This is an outrage ! 
- Murder ! 
It 's so terribly , terribly important . 
It 's all my fault . 
And stop straining your tonsils while your voices are changing . 
If I did , it was a mistake !

Look , are you hurt ?

They murdered him - like they murdered the other five .

They must have been in a state of suspended animation .

He doesn 't really mean to be such a pain in the neck , Jerry . 
The offensiveness isn 't really individual . 
Don 't worry , Ma . 
I 'm supposed to be murdered . 
Listen , Corbett , this is very embarrassing to me . 
Why , the man is insane . 
And then again , I may be wrong .

He was an ace in the last war . 
You must have been about 11 or 12 in the last war . 
You wanna kill him ? 
No talk of killing , Ben .

You 're frightening my gentleman . 
- Stupid ? 
I 've got no tools , and there 's no workbench here . 
I haven 't come back a poor man . 
He denied flat ever having heard of ya . 
The prisoner has entered no denial . 
- Who , I rob ? 
I 'll be no longer guilty of this sin , this sanguine coward . 
I was a coward on instinct . 
I 'll to the court in the morning , we must all to the wars . 
Farewell , poor Jack . 
I hath to pretend to be dead . 
Thou whoreson little boar- pig ... 
Thou wilt set me a weeping an thou sayest so . 
Thou globe of sinful continents . 
All shall die . 
Jesu , Jesu , dead . 
Jesu , and dead ? 
- Dead .

Too bad about those two German couriers .

He didn 't die any too soon for us . 
The monster was burned to death by Dr. Frankenstein . 
Lock up these murderers . 
There 's no use in storming the ruins . 
It must be destroyed by the same means . 
He died a horrible death , just as my grandfather did . 
- Attack ? 
Man , but she was ugly . 
But it can be very difficult ? 
There will be danger if he begins to hide the sadness . 
Maybe not so good . 
I would have made a good man , but I 'm all woman and all ugly . 
It isn 't a jealously that lasts . 
- You don 't have to worry about her . 
- I don 't think he 's so drunk . 
I 'll still be alive , when you 're all dead ! 
When the war broke out , he wasn 't the man you see now . 
They knew they had to die . 
No , I 'll go alone . 
They know the Republic is going to attack when the sun rises . 
Didn 't I tell you he was a coward ? 
Is there no other way to explode the charges ? 
Don 't be angry . 
No , Roberto , no !

- This is a bad town for blonds . 
What did they say before the bad card came up ? 
He doesn 't think his leopard killed the girl in the cemetery . 
- She had no enemies . 
Anything in Clo- Clo 's death to suggest it wasn 't the leopard ? 
I hear her screaming , " Raoul , get me out ! " 
Nonsense Watson , it was the house settling . 
Nasty crack on the head .

What worries me is why this meeting was arranged . 
It 's as stupid as that : 
The son threatened the father and discord overcame the city . 
Instead of finding the poison pen , you spy on his victim . 
But if the police failed ... 
" You old cadaver ... you have liver cancer . 
But if she were guilty , I 'd turn her in . 
You know who was behind his death ?

We can 't be haunted by him all our lives . 
Yonder she lies , Stanley . 
They forced us to prepare dinner . 
Oh , Stanley , you and Oliver will be the death of us yet . 
They betrayed me . 
We 're failures . 
Let no one say that we were afraid to die . 
What 's wrong ? 
I can see you 'll never go to heaven . 
Don 't worry . 
She 's poor , too . 
He told me that his kid is sick . 
That was dumb . 
She faces girl number 2 in a fight to death

Cecile is dead ? 
In Paris , she would have ended badly . 
- Are you the one who was attacked ? 
He was arrested immediately .

In the event of my death ? 
That 's too bad , that 's too bad . 
Mr. Ordway is slightly eccentric but that shouldn 't trouble you . 
Oh , how unfortunate . 
He seems a bit frightened , Holmes . 
What an unpleasant habit . 
I knew you for what you were , a flagrant liar .

This circle is where the murder actually occurred . 
I 'm sorry but I 'm frightened of everything and everybody . 
He killed her ? 
He 's dead ? 
Journet 's the only man who can lead us to the murderer . 
It 's extremely regrettable the murderer has escaped us . 
It 's a pity Marie had to be killed . 
He 's got the wrong pig by the ears this Mr. Giles Conover .

No , no shot . 
Back broken huh ? 
Well strike me dead if it isn 't sir . 
When , was it Wednesday the day after the thief was taken ? 
But it 's my poor eyesight Mr. Harder . 
He 'll be off to the wrong end of town presently . 
Don 't worry about The Creeper . 
Broken ? 
Drop that gun . 
Probably lose my boat , too . 
Don 't make me feel bad . 
I thought you said you were broke . 
Don 't shoot !

Once you get over the first fear , it 's a piece of cake . 
Anybody who would is a piece of shit . 
You violated this section , and I 'm not gonna cover your ass . 
I don 't give a shit . 
No , never , but of happiness . 
You know , we had a real , live murder there . 
You 've cast out fear for me . 
She had been strangled .

I 'm so tired . 
For the things for which Alice Alquist was murdered : 
No , you can 't deceive me . 
You must be tired .

Where nobody can hurt us . 
Why are you so angry ? 
He wants to talk to you , he 's got problems . 
She 's come to curse our animals . 
- Our animals will die . 
That poor woman sinned . 
Don 't worry about me . 
Don 't insult me , I 'm a bone cracker . 
I took the medicine because Maria Candelaria was ill . 
It was desperation . 
For stealing the medicine that would cure me . 
Take these men and the Indian to the prisoner in cell 30 .

There 's no risk . 
They might try to hang a murder around his neck . 
It 's a bad guess . 
- Is he a bad boy ? 
These things are so difficult to believe . 
Take a private dick who 'd risk his neck for $100 . 
I just don 't want anything to hurt him .

Are you in such an all- fired hurry , lady ? 
The rudeness of people in these parts is appalling . 
There 's going to be trouble . 
Don 't worry . 
You made a fool of yourself over him once .

Which I regret . 
For your information , you stuck it in your own ass ! 
I am so sick of that guy ! 
You are a sick pup .

Was someone frightening you ? 
Terribly hot , isn 't it ?

I broke a date with Janie Clarkson to come here tonight . 
Twelve years with the wrong husband ? 
I have no right to feel hurt . 
Oh , this is very difficult to explain to a child . 
The Nazis don 't frighten him , but they frighten me , so ... 
Georgie , I look dreadful , don 't I ? 
You 're lying . 
- I never did care for drinking alone . 
Who the devil is that ? 
My killer 's instinct is aroused . 
Georgie , don 't look so worried . 
Has Trippy done something awful ? 
Oh , this is gonna be even worse than I thought . 
- No hardship ? 
It 's a painful subject . 
- You 're very stubborn . 
The trouble with Fanny is , she 's soft- hearted .

Not even bad- looking , in a strange sort of way . 
If I 'm sorry nothing came of it , I 'm a liar . 
- You 'll see nothing but me , beautiful . 
No work , no nothing . 
And you can get mad if you want to . 
Is 45 minutes something to make a crisis about ? 
I was scared to death . 
- I 'll wager the coffee is rancid . 
And we 'd probably be struck dead , and ...

If we fail , our people will die under the heel of the Khan . 
Does the little mouse fear aged camel drivers and slave girls ? 
He is one of the thieves , it is hard telling what they will do . 
Would you rather starve and die for a lost cause ? 
You brought me water when I was a prisoner . 
The terror of Baghdad ! 
Why must you weaken now ? 
Ali Baba will slay Amara and then kill me .

When I catch the lousy student , who took my shoe ! 
Hang that sign back up , damn it . 
You are becoming more and more dumb . 
That is too bad ! 
Are you afraid that you 'll fail your final exam ? 
A murder ? ... or lead your daughter astray ? 
- Then you 'll both starve .

If I starved longer , do they have to try to finish the job ? 
- Don 't worry . 
It 's trouble ? 
It 's catastrophe . 
Didn 't I tell you that all your worries are over ? 
Suppose you 're tired and worried about a problem . 
Mr. Jones , I 'm very tired .

You 'll lose your shirt , Whiteman . 
Practically broke . 
And starve in a Greenwich Village garret . 
What are you so nervous about ? 
What are you so nervous about ? 
Nonsense . 
I lost all my money on the Dempsey- Tunney fight . 
You 're not happy in New York . 
You mustn 't waste a minute . 
How bad is it ? 
You know , sometimes I think George is unhappy . 
Don 't worry , Poppa .

It only means more fight . 
Don 't worry .

You approach all your problems with an icepack on your head .

About where it hurts ? 
It 'll do the boy no harm . 
He killed the dog .

Punctuality is the thief of time , harry says . 
I did not expect to hear the devil 's advocate at your table . 
What wickedness are you contemplating ? 
I 've always thought your wickedness supposed . 
It would have failed . 
There can be something fatal about a portrait . 
She died many years ago , when you were only a little girl . 
If i were to marry you , it would be an incredible wickedness . 
You make it so much more difficult for me . 
Is that my fault ? 
And green or dry , a man must die before it bears its fruit .

You poor little thing . 
Poor Francis . 
Really Sally , this is too bad ! 
You see Mr Craig is going to hit me savagely . 
- One pint of bitter . 
Suppose I am going mad . 
Arrogant , fractious , handsome and of a violent temper . 
How dreadful . 
Something gone wrong with your plans for a weekend ? 
You think I 'm a contemptible coward . 
Still cheating ? 
- Not nearly despicable as cheating at golf . 
The spell has been broken at last . 
Hey , you old war horse . 
Hell , I 'm soaking . 
Maxwell , this fellow is as stupid as you are . 
Poor Sylvester ! 
Don 't let it worry you a bit 
- The war 's over , you know ?

Because it only reminds me - I might have killed him .

That 's a coward 's way . 
Poor fellow . 
He attacked me the minute he saw me . 
You don 't want it because you 've had all the worst of it . 
- There 's a war on , Anna . 
- Were you ashamed of me ? 
Don 't you try to make me feel guilty . 
No , no . 
Very perverse .

No faults , no jealousies .

Gee , that 's terrible . 
That 's an awful thing to do to .

Most embarrassing . 
This is the way he makes his kill . 
-- The dead ! 
Oh , no , no ! 
After all , was ill . 
Poor man . 
7 indiecitos cut wood , one was cut in half ... ... and were 6 . 
He is right , an unfortunate neglect . 
If not regressing , so beaten . 
I am guilty . 
Who killed Blore ? 
Minutes later , he had no to worry about . 
Dying publicly the gallows is not pleasant .

It 's Donald , he 's so upset and it 's way past his bedtime . 
Sure , but we got in trouble , we picked up a kid .

That 's too bad . 
He kills me . 
The dead man was Owen Taylor , Sternwood 's chauffeur . 
I 'll go out with the other suckers .

Nasty habit , too . 
I 'm too old for that kind of war work . 
Even when the war 's over ? . 
Fag ends , fag ends , fag ends . 
You did pinch that fag of young ... 
No , no , the Jane , the strip in the " Mirror " . 
All British prisoners will parade at once . 
No , a bomb . 
There 's a murder on practically every page . 
You must think of your husband as dead . 
I 'm a bigger fool than you are . 
Why did you have to believe that idiot ? . 
Don 't worry , Captain Hasek . 
From the prison camp . 
What a fool I was . 
I 'll kill you ! 
You threatened to kill me . 
They 're made in a very stupid way . 
Don 't lose it . 
Oh , Danilushka , you 're working yourself to death . 
- You can find no fault with it . 
Even your eyes got dull . 
But afterwards you will regret it . 
I can 't say anything bad about you . 
I 'm in trouble ! 
Philip , you 're wasting your time . 
He 's dead . 
You make the child very unhappy . 
Who 's fooling ? 
Can 't get in unless you 're sick . 
Who 's fooling ? 
you 're going to make daddy mad . 
And suddenly one 's whole life is shattered . 
I wouldn 't worry about it , if I were you . 
You 're making it very difficult for me . 
Scandal ? 
The prisoner may sit . 
I say you 're a fool ! 
I bet you it ain 't big enough to choke on as it goes down . 
That you and the prisoner 
Did you call at the prisoner 's home ? 
Was anyone there besides the prisoner Fallon ? 
For the duration of the war . 
In Norfolk for perjury ? 
Tonight , it 's itching like the devil . 
It 's broke , the record , in the middle . 
But that 's exactly what I 'm afraid of - A scandal . 
You 'd even give your own life to destroy mine , 
Even if it 's unpleasant . 
Oh , that isn 't so bad , is it , David ? 
Except that I must hold you on a charge of perjury . 
He 's dead ? 
I meant no harm when I did what I did . 
Oh , no , no . 
But it wasn 't murder . 
This is an evil room . 
I tell you , the devil is beside me . 
Man : been a murder , he says , a woman ! 
It lies in ourselves .

You 're exhausting !

She could have been killing people for years . 
No harm done . 
Then stop worrying , there 's no need for it . 
You scare me half to death sometimes . 
Terry is not well ... she 's sick ... inside . 
He tries to escape from them and is killed . 
It offends me , sir . 
No weapons . 
Sims will make them suffer for that blow . 
Enough of that boring , dull man and his cruelty . 
Don 't worry , my questions are pert enough . 
How deep that contempt is , I am about to show you . 
My parents are dead , and I have no husband or child . 
Oh , don 't fool yourselves .

Designed for a death trap . 
We shall find it and we shall punish them .

Here 's a samurai sword , Rob . 
And here 's a flag I found on a dead Jap soldier . 
Rob , aren 't you going to take the souvenirs Father brought you ? 
It 's terrible to be old , isn 't it ? 
It isn 't your fault . 
- This is the " worse " . 
lf you wanna make anything out of this , you 'll be disappointed . 
We don 't need to worry about that child . 
It 's humiliating , and it 's killing his spirit . 
You think my poor little heart is broken . 
We fought the wrong people , that 's all .

This is such nonsense ! 
One is starved for Technicolor up there . 
I 've got bad news . 
Do you know what 's wrong with him ? 
Insanity ? 
Stupidity has saved many a man from going mad . 
He was 81 when he died . 
First American killed by a British bullet . 
Get the fire extinguishers and the blankets ! 
Nothing to be ashamed of . 
- No mistaking you . 
Young devil ! 
Would you be willing to die for him ? 
Have you gone mad ? !

Of the three children you 're the most stupid . 
Some bad news ? 
I thought you were dead . 
If you can 't make it , you 're dead . 
Alcohol fumes , a no- no . 
I wouldn 't be so cruel . 
How it must have troubled you ! 
And the war ? 
That same night , I was sad and alone . 
You 're not happy to see me after two months ? 
You see me , Papa , lying there ? 
Perhaps you 'd cry . 
The war will end . 
Was it an accident ? 
That would be too frightful . 
It 's sad .

Hit 's awful what a gal 'll stoop to do !

- Tragic . 
- I 've tortured you enough . 
I 've never seen it to fail .

It 's not like Thelma to cut herself off from her family .

You weren 't bad as the finance company . 
Is that an accident ? 
- No , I 'm no fool !

A serious defect in business . 
I waited for you in vain . 
You will live your life oblivious to pain ... 
He meant to kill you . 
But he will bring us trouble . 
Did you his wife had died ? 
It takes a stubborn person . 
You have behaved in a childish , ridiculous way . 
We shall go together to salvation ... ... or to death . 
Like I can 't prove that you are a murderer either , Officer . 
No more aches and no more pain 
Too bad about McLain . 
Accident ? 
- He 's sick . 
In a war , people cry easy . 
Don 't be discouraged , Warden . 
You 're wrong . 
I 'm sick , Joe .

All you do is give me trouble . 
That poor young man . 
It was rumored some sort of trouble with the leading lady . 
You killed them . 
- Didn 't hurt too much , did it ? 
Would be a shame , wouldn 't it ? 
It did all during the war . 
He 's got face more worse than me . 
To keep away death . 
They 've got a couple of bad boys out looking for you . 
Too bad they had to turn you down . 
Too bad Shorty turned out to be a crook . 
20 years for stealing from the government is also a headache . 
You mean you know the kind of trouble he 's in ? 
Somebody else was hurt ? 
One is dead . 
You are sick . 
Because they are bad . 
Why should I worry about her ? 
No , she don 't worry you at all . 
Oh , is sad word .

Besides , you 're a dead giveaway .

You get in all kinds of trouble , don 't you ?

Hans is ill . 
Nobody 's mad at you any more . 
How awful . 
The smell of rats and mould and poverty . 
Why are you crying ? 
Not sadness . 
No , I don 't want to scare you . 
What 's the trouble ? 
Wrong , as usual . 
Maybe the trouble is , my name isn 't Johnny . 
So you picked the worst hoodlum in town . 
He 's got a grouch on . 
When a guy 's pal is killed , he ought to do something . 
I 'm so scared . 
What 's the trouble ?

Brutality has always revolted me as a weapon of the witless .

The man is a coward .

Dead ? 
- Bareheaded before death , coward . 
Oh , no , not before God , de Silva . 
Prisoner escaped from the lower cell !

The man is a coward .

Dead ? 
- Bareheaded before death , coward . 
Oh , no , not before God , de Silva . 
Prisoner escaped from the lower cell ! 
I remember this trail from the Moorish wars . 
Oh , the devil .

I 'm sorry to disturb you 
Was run off and severely wounded 
Don 't be cruel , jim . 
Jeff , do you ever get tired 
I wouldn 't worry about that if I was you , colonel . 
Worked him over bad ? 
My fault , lutie not yours . 
A lot of them may die . 
No we can quit stealing their cheese . 
If anything goes wrong , at least I won 't die poor ! 
She 's crying . 
A little killing ... 
This kid 's in a lot of trouble . 
Mad about her . 
No use worrying . 
" Or it 's mad " 
" Or it 's bad " 
You know he 's weak . 
You 're just a weak spineless jellyfish . 
This is murder . 
Trouble . 
You don 't wanna kill me .

Here 's to ... ... stolen moments . 
Too much studying can pollute the soul . 
And what happens if the plan goes to hell ? 
Honey , don 't panic . 
My wife has no enemies . 
They got a fuck of a lot more money , for one thing . 
This man is a career criminal . 
Hire someone to kill you ? 
And what happens if the plan goes to hell ? 
And then he attacks you ? 
Reply with contempt . 
You must be tired . 
Anyway , life is destruction . 
It will cause trouble . 
Is it so wrong , even if it 's a matter of life and death ? 
But otherwise , we 're heading for ruin . 
Damn ! 
I reduced him to suffering . 
Miss Matsui died . 
I didn 't mean to hurt them . 
- Father 's no longer interested in murders . 
Was anyone hurt ? 
Do you always feel so light- hearted about murder ? 
If a guy owes you money and you kill him , he can 't pay you . 
I always thought he was a bad risk . 
Why don 't you ask me if I killed Tommy Drake ? 
How could you leave him alone with a strange woman ? 
He needs a beating every noW and then . 
The Bryce tragedy ? 
You are aWare of the origin of this curse , aren" t you ? 
You haven" t done anything Wrong . 
- Why are you lying to me ? 
Some sicK pranK , if you asK me . 
I don" t Wanna die ! 
- Damn it ! 
Get the fucK aWay from me ! 
You met one of the bad shots . £70 . £70 . 
I didn 't steal it . 
Slavery hasn 't taught me forgiveness . 
I 'm sorry , sir , this woman 's in distress ... 
Maybe I 've come to the wrong village . 
There 's worse behind . 
You know , they can make a lot of trouble for runaway slaves . 
Hey , what are you crying about ? 
The one you tried to kill will be my wife . 
He 's a sick man . 
Clark , we 'll inform Captain Ecuyer in his sick room . 
Something 's wrong with that column . 
Marriage frees you from slavery , Mrs. Holden .

Rather kill you ! 
Your ears are dirty . 
You insult me . 
Don 't make me suffer any more ! 
You 're turning me into a bad woman ! 
- Liar ! 
Screaming , swearing , bickering , vermin , filth ! 
If I don 't commit suicide first ! 
It is really a shame . 
Don 't forget to kill my wife too . 
You are afraid of death ? 
But I think it 's useless . 
You seem so -- cynical . 
No , no , no . 
You 're infected with the poison of his agnosticism . 
Weeping Water , Nebraska . 
Do we curse the man who denies the word 
I regret very much . 
I withdraw the contempt citation . 
Col. Brady -- no , no , no . 
Ridiculous ! 
Bertram Cates has been found guilty . 
The prisoner will rise to hear the sentence of this court . 
The national tearduct from Weeping Water , Nebraska . 
Priest or not , I won 't be taken for a fool . 
Quit insulting the Lord 's name in my presence . 
He never said to submit to unfair punishment . 
- Scared of what ? 
They demand things , they insult us , they spit on us ! 
The poor are people . 
Those women who abandon them know that ? 
You 'll tend to the poor for the first time tomorrow . 
That no power in this world would stop her ... 
No trouble at all . 
I mean , sometimes things are a lot worse than they look . 
Oh , Martha , you 're being disgustingly mid- Victorian . 
Now , now , son , don 't get the wrong idea . 
- No , no , no ! 
- No , no , no . 
- No , no , no .

Frankly , I think they 're stuck on you and resent me . 
- He wants to go so badly . 
That dog is ... is dishonest . 
- Of course it hurt ! 
- In my book , a marriage without trust doesn 't amount to much . 
So it isn 't me you 're jealous about , it 's her farm . 
Why don 't you poison me and marry her ? 
No denying that . 
My husband 's been delayed , and I hate being home alone . 
They regurgitate it in order to kill and eat again . 
- One pompous ass ... 
- Whatever the hell that means ... 
- You little shit ! 
You think I 'm stupid ? 
My nephew died recently . 
I would 've known nothing of my husband 's death . 
They 're both dead . 
Julie , those are dangerous accusations . 
He was lying . 
No doubt you 've noticed their portraits around the walls . 
Something wrong ? 
I don 't think he is dead . 
Why did you keep her a prisoner ? 
Don 't worry . 
She was strangled . 
Then I tried to kill myself . 
All of them steal all the time . 
Oh , Steve , you so desperately want to face your son again . 
I couldn 't possibly have strangled her . 
Don 't you worry about anything . 
I know he killed her . 
Anything I say from now on will be the ravings of a maniac . 
And he is under indictment for murder , isn 't he ? 
I 'm going to have to trouble you for that raincoat . 
His hands are all scratched and torn as if he strangled her . 
Your being mad is silly , and you know it . 
I haven 't been there since before the war . 
I did something bad . 
- Poor devil . 
You know you 're being very rude to me ? 
Of course you got beaten . 
You 're wrong . 
You mustn 't think because anybody 's unhappy , they hate you . 
I warn you , no nonsense . 
Unhappy childhood with a poor relative whom you left . 
Because of him , I may have to go back to prison . 
Ruin Alfred ? 
Last night behind my window , I was unhappy . 
This is a horror museum . 
For 10 years I have associated only with the dead . 
Don 't hurt me unnecessarily . 
" Kill him ! " ... 
It would hurt me to say no . 
He 's going to shoot ! 
And find a cure for that ugly " keptomania " of yours . 
And we haven 't found even a miserable job . 
Mr. José Enrique is very drunk already , boss . 
Poor guy . 
And how the hell do you expect me to know who she is ? 
All our efforts to find him have failed and we fear the worst . 
The National gets worse every day . 
Don 't be a fool . 
What do you get by getting into trouble ? 
To hell with business , 
I knew something was wrong . 
If he shows up again here at the casino , kill him like a dog . 
- Killed here , in the casino ? 
Poor José Enrique . 
Go , don 't worry .

- Killed here , in the casino ? 
Poor José Enrique . 
Go , don 't worry . 
Chaotic . 
You 're wrong . 
But they are cruel tears … this sorrow 's heavenly . 
Kills her dead ... 
This did I fear , but thought he had no weapon . 
No , his mouth is stopped . 
Weep 'st thou for him to my face ? ! 
Sleep terribly ? 
Helpless . 
It doesn 't feel bad now . 
Chaotic .

I had not come so far only to jump at the wrong moment . 
- No , I 'm alone . 
There 's trouble with Brewer and Corkery , Pinkie . 
- I was scared . 
A suicide pax .

I never heard anything so ridiculous . 
That 'll give you something to worry about . 
I hate him . 
Something that no one should miss 
I hate it , and I loathe it . 
The baby died while you and Fenella ... 
And , sadly , to sleep I go , 
He can kill ! 
A sad road for one to make ... 
No grieving today ! 
A sad road for one to make ... 
How could I live without you for 3 years in prison and exile ? 
- You 're arrested . 
Bukov , for example , is simply furious . 
It doesn 't matter that you 're poor and already 18 years old . 
Don 't be angry , Dunya . 
A sad road for one to make ... 
The sacred war ! 
The torturers of people ! 
The sacred war ! 
- Shoot the tires ! 
I hate light . 
- If I could keep you from killing ... 
I want 30 dead every day . 
Too bad . 
My questions are probably going to be useless . 
Unfortunately for him , he was of no use to me anymore . 
No , Madame Helene , no . 
- You started to horrify me . 
Too bad ... 
I don 't wanna trouble you . 
Why . you ugly pair of goldbricking K. P. ' s . 
We 'll drown them . 
I 'm terribly unhappy . 
Don 't worry . officer . 
I wouldn 't deprive you . 
I guess there 's no use crying over spilled milk . 
Terribly urgent . 
Don 't worry . 
I 'm not gonna stand here and discuss your death . 
Baby , don 't you cry 
You 'll die ! 
Not bad , as force of impact ! 
Last night he injured his arm . 
- You 're right : they 're useless . 
You 've got to kill . " 
You hate me then ? 
It don 't hurt anything . 
I 'm not much good with a gun . 
I know that 's an irritating quality in a husband , 
They say it hurts a lot . 
What a crude thing to say ! 
Hey , what’ s wrong ? 
It’ s quite a shock . 
Don’ t be stupid . 
- If you run into trouble , come and talk to me . 
They say it hurts a lot . 
What a crude thing to say ! 
Hey , what 's wrong ? 
Quite a shock ! 
Don 't be stupid . 
I 've gone along with this gag long enough . 
Was anyone hurt ? 
It pains me to have to threaten you , Your Majesty . 
A murder ? 
You killed Grubich , and it was supposed to be me . 
Ugh ! 
No , no , no . 
Trying to scare me , huh ? 
It 's dangerous . 
It 's been a tough war . 
No , it was nothing like it . 
They 're trying to kill me . 
Not only that , but I 'm a coward . 
How long have you been hiding what you 've been hiding ? 
He 's as dead as he 'll ever be . 
You 're under arrest for the murder of Minister Grubitch ! 
Don 't be an idiot . 
Josef , if he makes a move , fire ! 
- Oh , no , I 'm not wearing it , thanks . 
No , no , no , thank you . 
This means being crazy , reckless . 
Maybe you 're tired ? 
After all , what is she doing wrong ? 
I only regret one thing , not to be able to see you any more . 
- Bad- mannered ! 
You know I was so ill last night ? 
Two attempts at suicide during the first convalescent period . 
An injured brain isn 't always logical , Mr Graham . 
The man who had your room before complained . 
Did he , er ... tell you about that accident I had ? 
Because the child was killed ? 
You 're talking about the dead ! 
Sorry to have disturbed you . 
Do they think he murdered her ? 
But the fear 's come back again . 
I 'm tired , Jenny . 
23$ for the damage of the push car , 12$ for the bananas ... 
- She 's a little depressed . 
The man is already dead . 
You never told me Bruno was dead . 
Don 't worry . 
Don’ t put the blame on me ! 
One can fall ill because of that ! 
She does everything to drive us crazy ! 
But you 've shrieked it was ugly ! 
Don’ t curtsey on stairs , it is very dangerous . 
I am ashamed to confess , you are right . 
Nonsense ! 
I scared you , my child ! 
I try to , annie , but it 's not easy . 
In spite of what you said about my father , it was kind of you . 
Now don 't you take any nonsense from annie . 
No , i was - come , come , georgie , you can 't be that blind . 
He 's dead anyway . 
Drink 's an evil habit , georgie . 
It 's the dire bubonic plague of the soul . 
That 's the worst of it . 
I know you will , but we don 't want any trouble here . 
He 's got a very nasty cut . 
This is your revenge , is it ? 
Bad news is no 
The evil spirits don 't like it . 
Oh , I 'm mad about him . 
I already did it before I remembered to get mad . 
I was only fooling , n 'est- ce pas ? 
Peter Van Dyne , ill has it . 
I was wrong . 
Beef , look at poor Connie . 
- Beef will kill whoever comes near you . 
- You 're crazy ! 
No , no , in front ! 
Mad as you can possibly get , then 
He 's just so dumb . 
Oh , don 't worry , Pat . 
I 'm not gonna let a little old football game upset me ! 
It 's so awful . 
" Oh , a girl could do worse . 
Badly ? 
I wanna eat , 'n eat , 'n eat ' N eat , 'n eat until I die 
And he gets killed ... dead . 
No , no . 
And he got killed , dead . 
No , no . 
Have I ever failed to tell you when someone called ? 
I find this extremely painful . 
Bad ? 
I 'm afraid she 'll be a problem for you too .

Why , Daniel , I believe you 're jealous . 
Oh , you 're such a fool . 
Henry 's old church , perishing from neglect . 
Oh , I 'm terribly sorry I 'm so late .

Are you afraid of death ?

I bring Your Lordship a prisoner . 
Still want to marry this lying impostor ?

When he died last year ... 
Forgive me , I 've had a hell of a day 
He avenges the insult , earns the money and gets rid of his wife

Even when I 'm lying dead in my coffin , 
The moment I caught all the sadness within me disappeared . 
I made it thinking that death isn 't a scary thing after all . 
I 'm the one who really died . 
Grief will only be for Master . 
With bald head around , no thief about . 
Master we stole the medicine for your illness . 
Don 't bully the weak . and handicapped . 
The word is full of evils . 
Brother , you look grim .

It don 't hurt none to put on the dog . 
Why couldn 't it have been you that got killed instead ofJohnny ? 
You dirty scum .

We stink up the street . 
They kill his brother , and he throws a rock through a window . 
It only makes it worse .

They will kill you . 
Yet your warriors kill them . 
A fool sees only today .

Marty 's worse about business than I am . 
For a moment , you had me frightened .

You 're talking about killing ... taking a man 's life . 
Was something wrong ? 
No , George , that 's not true . 
It would be a personal and bitter failure to me if I lost him . 
He has been hurt . 
" and I regret to my heart all unhappiness I have brought you . 
It wouldn 't hurt just to take her along . 
It 's very stupid . 
It lies in wait for the attack . 
Uh , as a scholar ... you permit no weakness in the attack .

- On your period , you anorexic fucker ? 
This team isn 't about your damn stats . 
Let him block . 
There 's something wrong with Shark . 
He 's fucked up . 
Sharky motherfucker . 
I ain 't trying to disrespect nobody . 
Just because you some scared old man . 
I ain 't trying to kiss no overrated loser 's ass . 
But , shit , now , prima dogs . 
They couldn 't take a piss in the morning without their pills ! 
Oh , fuck it . 
What the hell are you doing starting Cap ? 
I pissed away all my money , believe it or not . 
It 's been way too long not to win a big one . 
I 'd rather drown than starve to death in a Jap bow pen . 
No , don 't shoot ! 
Or maybe it was your arguments . 
Maybe they are only trying to scare us . 
Don 't worry , when Americans drop bombs , they hit Japs not us . 
- No , no . 
How bad is it ? 
- It 's a crime . 
Don 't worry . 
[ Both Weeping ] 
I 'm sorry , but I must refuse your invitation . 
I reckon I don 't have to say that I 'm disappointed . 
What is my anguish to thee 
Don 't forget ... this is business , not pleasure . 
Ah- ah , temper , temper . 
You fool ! 
No more tricks , huh ? 
Shall we take the prisoners back to town , sir ?

I mean , why make enemies ? 
Don 't be too disappointed . 
I was getting awful tired sleeping up there in that hayloft . 
Losers weepers 
Losers weepers 
Don 't worry about that . 
Losers weepers 
You might think it 's an awful squabble 
We 're heading 'cross the river Wash your sins away in the tide 
Wash your sins away in the tide 
Heading 'cross the river Throw your sins away in the tide 
Not bad for a Tuesday night , huh ? 
Who dares to call them frauds ? 
That maniac in a baseball hat . 
No , no . 
Right now , all I got is one rotten tune . 
We 're tired . 
The ball took a bad hop ? 
- It wouldn 't hurt . 
I wanna find out what 's wrong with sheep . 
Hey , listen , this dude wants to know what 's wrong with sheep . 
Too bad . 
We found that out in the last sheep war . 
- No , but i don 't want any trouble . 
- Me , stubborn ? 
- There is much trouble coming , sahib . 
This means war . 
You 're not going to Umballa , you 're going to war . 
I think it would be a crime to bind him to a heavy cart . 
We make no room for beggars or gutter thieves . 
Hold still , sire of all devils . 
Continual fear fattens me . 
An anna , O protector of the poor . 
For that alone , were I not a man of peace ...

Victor Mason , habitual criminal . 
Don 't worry about that . 
That 's too bad . 
Very regrettable . 
Any cop that 'll shake you down is a cop that 'll kill you . 
They 're going to have trouble with that one . 
He 's an evil man , too . 
No , no , no , no , don 't do that , Inspector 
I said , 'Don 't worry about it . ' 
Preferably dead . 
The one man who can ruin every plan 
A po ... 
Stop acting stupid . 
What 's wrong with it ? 
Don 't worry . 
Do you know how it feels to be scared ? 
Paul ... stop resenting us for just a little while .

The one you killed my brother with ! 
Personally , I ain 't got no stake in this war . 
- It gave him a hostage in case of trouble . 
I wouldn 't say you was exactly stupid . 
That old devil must have traveled 10 miles . 
- I 'm betting an awful lot on that , Plank . 
That never will they have a fiiner chance to kill the patrón . 
When I 'm losing , I cut my bets to the minimum . 
I don 't propose to waste more . 
Either way , it shows you have a haunted streak . 
It 's T. C. You hate , isn 't it , Vance ? 
- Don 't worry . 
- I 'm always wrong with you .

Madness ? 
We 're worthless insects . 
They 're gonna kill us . 
She 's the murderess ? 
She killed my father ? 
Ass . 
I mean , that Roxane should have no disillusionment . 
Afraid that when you have her all alone , you will lose her . 
Jealous ? 
I do not love you . 
But are they not sweet , those pretty phrases ? 
To face death everyday . 
Ugly ? 
Was he not a hero ? 
The battle was ours ! 
I never loved you . 
The tears you let fall for him , may for a little , be my tears . 
The poor sod didn 't understand that in every revolution - 
My husband is sick . 
- So the briefcase was stolen ... 
I killed him . 
A more humane way of killing . 
To kill someone else , you must be a murderer . 
Held by deep fear 
It 's the warning letter to pay the Radio Licence . 
I don 't understand what the hell you see in that bag of bones . 
Damn ? ! 
No- one can live on air alone 
Ugly I am not , but kind I am 
All he can do Is destroy Ioneliness 
Hell , they buttoned on to it ! 
There can 't be any worse . 
It only had one problem , it didn 't sweeten . 
Mind your mouth , don 't be rude . 
Some say worse things . 
You 're wrong , Francisca , I 've changed . 
How terrible ! 
I 'll cheat my diet today . 
I mean , he didn 't exactly die . 
All I wanted to say was that Mr. Ernesto killed an old tradition , 
Is there no danger of the police intervening ? 
There 's no danger of us ending up at Torel , then ? 
Don 't you worry , I 'll deal with them . 
Held by deep fear 
I 'll fight , even knowing I 'm going to die . 
But the truth is the worst thing we can tell her . 
- It 's just hurt . 
Titan ill ? 
- The bird died . 
The killer 's initials ? 
- The killer ? 
Just lonely nights spent in empty houses . 
Are you afraid to die , Frank ? 
How awful of Jared not to tell me . 
Not bad . 
For a moment I was almost jealous . 
Gun tackles away ! 
It appears I 've made a dreadful mistake . 
There isn 't going to be any trouble here . 
Narbonne 's mercy can be more dangerous than his threats . 
You little devil , you ...

For all I know my partner may be dead . 
Steve wanted to die . 
You just broke your date . 
She was there when he was killed . 
Like he 'd kill anyone who even said her name . 
Miss Raidoff ... ... l 'm Dick Manning from Detroit . 
It 's a criminal offense to withhold information from police . 
Because I 'm a coward . 
Doesn 't that kill you ? 
Don 't make me hurt you . 
Not until Solly was dead . 
- A poor girl . 
You drunk ! 
I messed things up ! 
- What 's wrong with her ? 
- Don 't get me wrong . 
I was inferior to a girl , who worked for her home . 
Let the dead be and see to the living . 
It 's my fault .

Death ... the cheapest show in Vegas . 
Works wonders on the disappointments of little girls . 
You think I killed him ? 
My agent told me it was dead as a doornail . 
Next time I 'll write you The Naked and the Dead . 
Later he strangled himself with it . 
Close , but no cigar . 
No , Phillip , no . 
Suddenly I find myself terribly afraid of losing you . 
- With a wildly beating heart . 
I didn 't want to hurt you . 
- Why , I thought she was dead . 
What 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ? 
Maybe it 's not very admirable .

Look at the dead body on the massage table in front of the fire . 
I hated " Bases Loaded " because I knew your name . 
Next time , I 'll write you " The Naked and the Dead " . 
Losing it is like losing my legs . 
Later he strangled himself with it . 
- Tails , that 's ridiculous ! 
- Close , but no cigar . 
I felt guilty , so I got out some of your old stories .

But the people he kills are real people . 
Their suffering 's over . 
If we don 't drive you out , there 'll be more killing . 
You come back to us in trouble and in pain . 
Strayhorn died in the swamp . 
If he kills one of my men with your gun , I 'll hang you . 
- You scared ? 
You 're worse than the man you killed . 
He wasn 't a bad guy , though . 
You come back to us in trouble ... and in pain .

I kept thinking of that poor Emily . 
Not a bad idea . 
- It was never love , Emily . 
- Is something wrong ? 
Are you hurt ? 
You have an experience that leaves you bitter . 
No , no , no , it 's too hot for chops . 
Mother , is there anything wrong ? 
You 've been violent , and you hurt me . 
Sick , sick , sick . 
While I 'm mad about your caress 
Life is not just tinsel pleasure 
Al , we got trouble . 
Don 't worry , we 'll take long rehearsals . 
- Trouble ? 
Al , don 't be angry at Jane . 
I knew the poor kid was off the beam . 
When I think of marrying you , I could stay sick forever . 
The house lose ? 
Killers . 
The dame 's no good to us dead . 
Irma , you 're hitting the wrong head ! 
- No , no . 
And we need it badly too . 
No , not when they won 't vote for you anyway . 
And you 're too old to stand there talking nonsense . 
Just because I 'm going to die . 
What might you be going to die of ? 
It 's all been a mistake ! 
Nothing further to worry about . 
Not bad at all .

I think you 'd like to know Mr. Bird is dead . 
You don 't go to people with your problems . 
Oh , that 's all wrong for this . 
You got the fake money in here ? 
I 'm looking at two dead men . 
- What 's taking him so damn long ? 
No , no , you first . 
- Where the hell 's Crowe ? 
- Negative . 
- They broke off on the piano . 
Don 't you worry , Mrs. Gilbreth . 
- Scared you , didn 't I , son ? 
- But it 's so embarrassing . 
- Is it going to hurt ? 
This is awful . 
He can 't scare me . 
- That 's too bad . 
- Oh , but Dad 'll murder you . 
Why , I 'd simply die before I 'd go out without my perfume on .

- We didn 't do so bad in Georgia . 
Stealing my hat ? 
There 's those known as bad men and those as are bad men . 
- Oh , he 's dead . 
Don 't worry . 
I 'm a wanted criminal . 
I should 've killed you weeks ago .

I am stubborn , and i do have a temper . 
You live with anger . 
It 's no trouble to keep an eye on him . 
Any gentleman would have provided a room for a lady in distress . 
Have you tired of havana so soon ? 
Where the stench can reach any nostril . 
- Don 't get in trouble ! 
An end to all this sadness ! 
I 'm sorry , but you 're all under arrest ! 
Menecu , if Francesco loses , he 'll make us all pay . 
The shooting scared them ! 
I know I made a mistake ! 
Damn it ! 
Everybody 's scared of Francesco ! 
Soccer would kill your boots . 
Other children steal the book . 
Your parents died . 
You know , they just wasted your time and your money . 
He questioned me as a prisoner . 
You navlechesh over problems in the coming days . 
They say you broke the rules . 
You call me dirty ? 
He fired me just now . 
You 're a bad man ! 
The workers will be guilty . 
We need to steal to survive . 
Bad things happen . 
Bastards ! 
The others will attack the farm if you stay here . 
She 's a singer , uses an obvious alias and smuggles diamonds . 
A smuggler who brought smallpox into the country .

Stop worrying about that . 
Don 't be stupid . 
Don 't worry about him . 
I don 't want anything dangerous . 
My leg is bad . 
Don 't be stupid . 
This is the problem ! 
- He was an abused child . 
The problem is Skylar . 
Weddings make a lot of people sad . 
I feel so guilty . 
But it’ s frantic in there . 
Mom bought Skylar a drop- dead wedding dress . 
He just got out of prison . 
He was in prison , not a finishing school . 
But remember , you’ ve been deprived of female contact . 
You’ re not in love with Holden ! 
No , no , no , no ! 
You’ re so drunk . 
And compared to the living , the dead may not be so badly off . 
Our different genders helped us start ... on the wrong foot . 
Shit ! 
Half the kingdom , and all that sort of nonsense . 
Shall I kill him ? 
Have no fear . 
You 've got an angel face , but you 're evil , baby ! 
What 's wrong with her ? 
You would have no difficulty instead . 
Don 't you cry , eh ! 
What should I worry about ? 
I 'm too tired , I 'm exhausted !

When confronting enemies , try this style of kung fu

You 'd rather bring out a dead body to scare us 
This old man 's kung fu is called " Frog " kung fu 
You both are equal ... no need to fight 
He was so worried and so down that ... 
You poor starved darling .

Tradition and prejudice ! 
I can never win your love . 
The house is on fire !

Are you scared of her ? 
A spinster has to kill time some way 
I 've been ill recently , so I 've taken some leave 
What kind of a thief steals from poor people like us ? 
She doesn 't scare anybody ! 
It soon gets messy without the wife around ! 
It tastes bitter

- That 's simply awful . 
I used to have the same trouble . 
You want those shrubs out there to die ? 
- Your figure isn 't bad at all . 
Terribly sorry I didn 't hear about it sooner . 
Our roses here are just lousy with aphis . 
- I guess I must be tired after your trip . 
You 'd make the worst husband in the world . 
- That 's not so easy with a small child . 
- Oh , he makes me so mad . 
You make me sick ! 
He never even mentioned it until I forced him to . 
I 'm having trouble with my climbers . 
You weren 't hurt so badly if you still play the ponies .

It 's really annoying , the rain . 
Poor , went for pimping , left kid here . 
It isn 't so simple , Sakai will be quite jealous if he knew . 
Thief !

Mum has her own business , don 't cry , honey . 
It 's a trouble . 
Wrong name , wrong woman . 
- Look , I 've got a problem too . 
He 's making a scrapbook of everything I kill . 
People don 't go to the movies to see how miserable the world is . 
She hates everything I do . 
That 's too bad . 
That 's too bad . 
Don 't look so trapped , Mark . 
Is he dead ? 
My last picture died there .

I never was in love with Mark Cardigan .

Flogging only makes a bad man worse , Mr. Gerard . 
Those are his rules of war . 
But , sir , you yourself said that Don Julian was mad . 
Surely it isn 't his fault that Spain changed sides in the war . 
- Fire as your guns bear ! 
Fire ! 
Her Ladyship is ill . 
Fire ! 
I am only a poor man .

For 19 of those years , fate denied me the one contact ... 
Why don 't you give that poor old devil a chance ? 
You 'll be the death of me , Holland ! 
What 's the trouble ? 
I told you it was madness to come back . 
For 19 of those years , fate denied me the one contact ... 
Why don 't you give that poor old devil a chance ? 
You 'll be the death of me , Holland ! 
What 's the trouble ? 
May I drop dead if I lie . 
- This is your first crime ? 
I told you it was madness to come back . 
But remember , if I fail , you 're for it too . 
That was one of our faults . 
If you are , I 'm too grown up to scare . 
Stay away from trouble , Owen . 
You 'll hate that . 
What a brutal question . 
There 'll never be peace that way . 
None of the crew knew Dutcher was going to kill them fellows . 
- I still think you 're lying , Repp . 
It would be murder . 
You 're hurt again . 
When I think you 're dumb , Johnson , I 'll let you know . 
Let me worry about the rest . 
That includes expectorating broken teeth , sir ? 
Now , sonny , you mustn 't terrorize the police . 
What 's the trouble , Captain ? 
You 're the one who arrested Joe . 
- But the Scanlon boy is guilty . 
Why you dumb cop ! 
The judge will have you suspended . 
You haven 't proved murder . 
Not his name , but I saw him kill Johnson . 
Constant fight , constant struggle . 
I am really so very tired . 
This is very sad . 
- the sadness that I see in - - Sadness ? 
" Don 't worry . 
Such a big , ugly pig ! 
- You don 't fool me . 
- But he is very bad . 
- No , no . 
Ah , Felix , I 'm sorry to have neglected you . 
- More tragic ? 
Then perhaps it is time I gave her something to worry about . 
The bad news . 
- You do not act very cheerful yourself . 
He teases her , fights with her , is cruel to her . 
How can they be poor ? 
Mrs. Chandler , the war 's over . 
But yesterday , somehow or other , I broke my coddler . 
War dance corny . 
Don 't worry . 
That sow ain 't been sick a day since we 've had 'im . 
It 's too bad you haven 't got electricity in the old house . 
Been gettin ' notices for 15 years , but no final one . 
- Oh , no , no . 
You fool around with it . 
Are you willing to , to go to the war ? 
There’ s the evil part . 
I said oh shit . 
No , no , no , Ed ! 
- Don 't feel bad , Jim . 
- Jim , ignorance is no excuse . 
Poor fellow . 
No , no , no , Ed ! 
- Don 't feel bad , Jim . 
- Jim , ignorance is no excuse . 
Poor fellow . 
People are tired of violence and blood : 
- Does he know his brother was killed ? 
Unrest amongst farm hands from the Po Valley ... 
Poor guy ! 
Don 't cry . 
As of tonight , we 'll no longer suffer . 
They only cause hate amongst us , even worse than before . 
That 's why the world 's in bad shape ! 
- Forbidden ... 
I was crying and shouting , you wanted to throw me in the river . 
You were reserved and sad . 
What happened here , why is everyone so disheartened and sad ? 
My mother 's vineyard was destroyed . 
Hate , vendetta , hypocrisy . 
One more corpse . 
Or in burying the dead . 
For all those who make us suffer , who make you poor boys suffer .

He 'll possibly kill you . 
He feels betrayed . 
You disturb me . 
With one arm strapped , you could kill 50 Nubians an hour . 
Your sacrifice will be in vain , commander .

His accessory in lust and crime . 
I denied Him thrice , 
Rome is on fire ! 
- and gave him to the raging mob ? 
- Punish the arsonists . 
You want me to punish him ? 
You have orders to guard the prison ? 
We inquired about Lygia , but in vain . 
Gods meant you to be a robber , you 've turned into a demon . 
No , no .

You 're very tired . 
Don 't hurt me more . 
Tomorrow he 'll be released and that means prison for him .

People are so greedy nowadays . 
There 's only one thing wrong with your theory . 
Oh , yes , but his wife died a long time ago .

Too bad he wasn 't re- elected . 
What 's wrong with trying to get votes ? 
Come here you bad , bad boy . 
No , Adrian , no ! 
They let the Indians die 
When the glass shattered my eyes were wide open ! 
Waiting for him To die , 
The only trouble With me is that 
He is very old And very ill , 
You 're not young enough To be this cynical . 
I told you you were a fool For ever letting him in . 
A crime or a will . 
He 's drunk - Blind , senseless drunk . 
I 'd prefer it To being your enemy . 
That 's not a very friendly thing to say . 
Than in the final Stupidity ... 
What could be wrong ? 
He wanted To kill himself ? 
Not realizing He was poisoned , 
So he 's dead . 
I’ m trying Desperately hard .

Having seen the grave he made his own private promise of revenge . 
He was looking at the man who was died . 
Iron Shirt is their cheif now . that means trouble . 
Since I found out that rustlers were sabotaging the war effort . 
If it hadn 't been for him , I 'd still be trapped .

Once a jerk , always a jerk . 
His bottom is sore , but she says it doesn 't hurt , 
" Unfortunately we cannot accept your draft , " 
You see , I 've been at the asylum , I 've been insane ,

Injustice ? 
She 's a fool and a coward . 
Are you yourself afraid of death ? 
To die is difficult . 
I fear my death less than yours . 
Are you trying to worry me ? 
I 'd hate myself the same if didn 't get what I wanted . 
Forcing a mother to burn the one relic of her dead child . 
I don 't reject theirs .

I 've got a very sick patient . 
- So there 's a very sick patient ? 
I was still wearing those pants we wore during the war . 
He was rather careless , leaving it lying around . 
Eat it and don 't worry . 
Too bad . 
Then stop crying . 
I saw her crying in the kitchen last night . 
But - don 't worry . 
You needn 't worry about that .

If I have to go where there 's another war , 
Old , ugly and mean . 
Hey , why are you crying ? 
As frightened as all those people would be if they knew .

You must be tired after this long journey . 
Sae , you must be very tired . 
- Is she suffering ? 
If it was he , I would not have the impression of losing you . 
One must not laugh ! 
I would say that a baby is crying in the garden .

Your sacrifice is in vain ... for it cannot be otherwise . 
You must not laugh ! 
It is very stressful for me and I cannot remain this way ... 
We 've been worried sick about you 
I said you 're not allowed to laugh ! 
Your son has been taken suddenly ill 
Are you in pain ? 
Ridiculous lies ! 
It 's better to be scared than to die in this stupid war . 
I 've been a real burden on your father . 
The Allies aren 't savages . 
Don 't worry . 
He 's probably dead by now . 
Dad was a coward . 
Only the stupid ones died . 
Don 't be horrible ! 
Hopeless ? 
If you tease your body , all you 'll do is damage it . 
- Stop lying ! 
I 'm so stupid . 
You 're torturing me . 
If I died ? 
I have to die , otherwise ...

I forgot all about Dick . 
Don 't worry we 'll do it . 
He 's weak and I just hate weak people . 
All my doggone cheating life . 
Why , you know I 've been a liar ? 
A double- crossing liar . 
- Oh I say that 's frightful . 
I always smile when I 'm heartbroken . 
It might be to you , but it 's terribly serious to him .

McLeod , I 'm going to press a felonious assault here . 
Lieutenant , I 'm not free to discuss it with you . 
What have you got to be ashamed of ? 
We 're here to prosecute criminals , not collect money . 
I say prosecute . 
Jim , I 'm terribly sorry . 
Dumb cop . 
- This has been a horrible day . 
- No , I didn 't want to hurt them . 
- Dirty pictures ? 
- Did she get dirty ? 
What a pain you are ! 
Don 't cry ! 
Poor thing , she 's not used to this and she 's a little scared ! 
- Don 't worry . 
- Don 't hurt me ! 
- You 're mad ! 
Don 't worry ! 
- I 'm tired . 
No , it was a genuine mistake ! 
What 's wrong with that ? 
Don 't worry ! 
- No , no ! 
You always say she 's unhappy with me ! 
Don 't worry about your heels . 
So ... don 't be cruel . 
- Woe betide " Roma " if they lose ! 
So many people ended up badly thinking they 'd make it in films . 
Don 't worry , Signora ... ... everything will work out . 
Are they talking badly of her ? 
Still waters that run deep usually stink ! 
But you have been ill ? 
Ridiculous ! 
No , it 's vile , wicked , awful ! 
Having failed at suicide , she 's decided to become a cripple . 
It was after my mother died . 
- Have I denied the fact ? 
Too bad I didn 't drink at the Middlesex . 
The clowns weep . 
I think I 'll stand up under the punishment . 
You 're as helpless as I am . 
No , you 're wrong . 
Wasted on an old man . 
He meant a world that had been denied me .

Why don 't we kill him ? 
- They 're so lazy . 
He was killed . 
Then he 's an enemy too . 
Kill that Zapata now . 
- You are no longer a prisoner . 
He tried to hold Huerta in check , and Huerta killed him ! 
You know our rule against consorting with the enemy . 
He killed a man who wouldn 't go . 
No wife , no woman .

" My word but I am distraught . " 
- How about poor Pasquale ? 
Don 't be jealous . 
Everyone 's going mad ! 
No problem . 
I 'm nearly crying . 
You needn 't be jealous . 
We 'll all end up mad .

No , I have no girl . 
Am I wrong ? 
You think a dance- hall girl had a dirty life ? 
I 'd be scared . 
Rotten kids . 
It 's my fault , letting my sister marry beneath her . 
He didn 't suffer from moods either . 
A man who isn 't mean and doesn 't hate women . 
I guess it must be terrible to get old and lonely . 
Believe me , somehow I 'd hurt you . 
It 's wrong . 
Get mad , get hot . 
I give him a drink , he gets sick . 
I 'd give an arm to take back the grief I 've caused you . 
- I don 't want to make you any unhappier . 
That heartless man connives , that blowhard Pfeiffer . 
I couldn 't get through my thick head that you never loved me .

It doesn 't concern anyone and Fredrik was obnoxious with Eugen . 
You 're lying , I see your nose becomes longer . 
Distorted , me ? 
It 's dreadful to swim with these big fish in the water . 
I believe my case is hopeless . 
You 've shattered my life . 
It 's pointless that she should ignore it , even if I ignored it . 
But we were so tense and melodramatic this day . 
Why are your eyes so sad ? 
The most serious is that he refuses to be at the funeral . 
Father is dead . 
Are you sad ? 
I 've revolutionised the export business and I 've got no foes . 
It 's a hormonal problem . 
Terribly . 
Where does he get all those stupid ideas from 
They 're doing something they believe is forbidden .

I 've been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it . 
- rather reckless . 
He died abroad ; in Paris , in fact . 
You couldn 't be so heartless as to disown him . 
Cecily , I am very much hurt indeed that you broke it off . 
I think there must be some slight error . 
Was he a victim of a revolutionary outrage ? 
That does not seem to me to be a very grave objection . 
I 've been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it . 
I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief . 
From the expression on Mama 's face , I fear we never shall . 
My wicked cousin Ernest . 
I have been rather reckless . 
You couldn 't be so heartless as to disown him .

What the devil did she expect ? 
Was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned ? 
It was horrible for him . 
I 've threaded it up wrong , as usual , or something . 
No , no .

If you 're gonna kill us , do it . 
That 's what I was selfish enough to tell myself . 
You 've been forcing yourself to face the worst facts . 
Their speech transmitter 's dead . 
Probably something as simple as valve failure . 
- This man 's ill . 
Only lose time . 
It would be difficult to remove from a sick person ? 
" Attempted suicide " . 
- Did they die ? 
Sometimes it 's a financial or family problem which is the cause . 
I thought life was horrible . 
- Do you live in the same block ? 
Poor thing ! 
Poor thing ! 
I 'm too tired . 
I 'm too tired . 
I 'm too tired . 
I 'm too tired . 
I 'm too tired . 
I 'm too tired . 
There 's nothing romantic in love . 
- An accident ? 
And Camille cheated . 
You 're not made for doing sad things . 
It 's forbidden to scratch Mrs. Raquin 's fabrics ! 
And I 'd have the right to kill him too . 
What do you want me to talk about when you 're trying to kill me ? 
For the moment , at least , there 's no immediate danger . 
And if Camille was killed , who decided that ? 
Sometimes you have to do unpleasant things . 
What nonsense . 
I told you that I intend to exhibit scenes of violence . 
See the Chamber of Horrors . 
The Chamber Of Horrors . 
- What a shocking thing . 
Horribly destroyed . 
What 's wrong with that ? 
It 's more a kind of fear , an intuition . 
- We think nothing of the kind . 
- Poor kid . 
It 's sort of a shock to see your head detached that way . 
Murder , torture , executions ... scare the life out of people . 
What nonsense .

Run down every man on this list and kill him . 
Not too bad . 
Too bad Josie isn 't here . 
Oh , boy , he get killed ! 
Or death . 
You can easily prove that you killed Dan Kurth in a fair fight . 
They cry out . 
I 'd choose to starve to dead there better than here . 
Those enemies will be silent if ... you wed Elaine . 
Wasn 't I such non crude a knight after all . 
I do not love you . 
Is he such as fool not to be watching us this very moment ? 
Guilty . 
Blind to save himself and his own grief and sick in the soul . 
I should have destroyed him . 
The devil himself has plowed it under . 
Fight the dragon banner to the earth ! 
The war is over , Lancelot . 
Those enemies would be silenced ... if you wed Elaine . 
I do not love you . 
- Guilty . 
Treason !

He killed a lot of people , didn 't he ? 
Otherwise you wouldn 't be so upset about staying . 
You remember I said it , O 'Horror . 
The trouble with England , it 's all pomp and no circumstance . 
Sin ? 
These are two very clever and dangerous antagonists . 
You could do worse . 
We thought you 'd both been killed . 
Perhaps it 's because when I thought you were dead , I - 
* Blow the man down , bully Blow the man down * 
Billy is a liar . 
Oh , no , no . 
The Vanmeer murder case . 
Did he ever make mention of any enemies , business or otherwise ? 
Criminal . 
You" re revealing your position to the enemy . 
And the colds and bad food and the empty conversation ? 
listening to bad conversation , 
He plans to destroy this fort . 
Trouble ? 
She" s in the quartermaster warehouse , held as a prisoner . 
Don" t worry about them . 
Your husband was killed because he wasn 't a murderer . 
If only you were ugly . 
Not bad . 
Any of them look stolen ? 
Hold your fire ! 
It 's with a gun in their hands ! 
Trouble is , I hold with the settlers instead of him . 
If there 's any trouble , they 'll only be in the way . 
Don 't worry , honey . 
- If you try to stop me now , Sheriff - - I 'm not gonna stop ya . 
Not bad .

Mrs. Cameron , I think our worries are over . 
- She was a mighty sick girl . 
The tetany test was negative . 
You 've got her all wrong . 
We 're sorry we had to cause you all this trouble . 
How would you like to have a death on your conscience - my death ? 
But this last attempt - This is the most contemptible of all ! 
- Worst ex- non- com in the division . 
Not bad for war surplus I got off the beach . 
- Hi , your climate 's lousy . 
Davidson came here and blamed me ? 
Don 't worry . 
It 's useless to discuss it . 
How do you know what I 've suffered ? ! 
It doesn 't matter why he killed himself . 
If he hadn 't done it , maybe I would have killed him myself . 
This girl -- she dumped you , all right ? 
# About the things I 've done so wrong ... # 
l -- I think they 're going to kill me . 
They 're going to kill me . 
You 've got the wrong family ! 
Shit ! 
Murdered your housekeeper ? 
- Absolutely ridiculous . 
He must be starving . 
- Don 't worry . 
And I 'll kill you . 
Maybe you 'll have to face problems that you never faced before . 
That hurt , didn 't it ? 
My mother died when I was at school . 
I 'm being selfish , aren 't I ? 
Why are you making it so difficult for me ? 
- Aw , get away , Misery . 
and may still destroy the you know , sir . 
Why did they trouble , I wonder ? 
I worked for the Norddeutsche Shipping Line a bit before the war . 
- She bore down on me worse than any old- time boatswain . 
It 's too bad she couldn 't be here , Brown . 
What a fool ! 
Don’ t you ever do such stupid thing again 
You fool ! 
Don’ t you worry 
If at times he seems a little eccentric or rude ... 
- I hated her . 
To me , it 's the noose that 's the wickedest looking .

To me , it 's the noose that 's the wickedest looking . 
But for you , an American tourist , there will be no trouble . 
I 'm bleeding to death . 
Thieves , thugs , ghosts , goons . 
When papa comes back , l 'il get everyone beaten up ! 
Come on , Minku , from now on , no one will trouble you . 
Should we keep our children starving for him ? 
All of them fell down miserably . 
Before the fire goes off , arrange for some food ! 
I am going mad ! 
We will destroy your sun and your air ! 
You 're completely useless . 
Say it was a lousy thing to do . 
Someday you may need a shoulder to cry on yourself . 
It 's been rumored that I 'm rather brutally frank . 
You 're right , it was dull . 
How stupid of me to ask . 
Why , we 're poor people . 
And don 't worry . 
I used to write drama and music reviews before the war . 
And I don 't hate you , Jenny . 
With the help of the Lord , I may yet conquer the evil in you . 
Don 't worry about it . 
Don 't shoot ! 
Has the prisoner anything to say ? 
Mother , it 's useless , there are so many girls competing . 
- They 're killing us , making us wait like this . 
When she 's a star , you 'll be dumped in the street . 
Fools ! 
- Don 't worry , I understand . 
I would hug you , but my hands are all dirty . 
- No , you 'll get all dirty ! 
You 've no idea how much trouble she caused . 
Look what a mess they are ! 
- Look , I hurt my leg . 
Look ... no , no playing with the gun ! 
- See , now you 've made me lose my voice . 
Get out of here , you bastard ! 
I 'm not Prince Charming , that would be pushing it ... 
Not bad . 
Don 't we have enough trouble without resurrecting that ? 
I didn 't kill him . 
They 've arrested my father . 
Rocco had betrayed me ! 
It is your fault an innocent man is suffering . 
I got your face dirty . 
I could get more , but there 's no time . 
It can 't harm us on board . 
Exposing us to the penalties for slavery . 
The fire god , he may kill you . 
Don 't worry . 
Next time don 't try to hide a gun up your sleeve . 
No , but what he can 't buy he gets through intimidation . 
Don 't worry , I learned from an expert . 
You let me worry about Frank . 
He 's so mad he wouldn 't eat any of his food . 
Next time don 't try to hide a gun up your sleeve .

And the head of priest Shinzei hangs by the Gate of Hell . 
- Have they been taken as prisoners ? 
The poor bastard ! 
The topic is quite serious ... ... and your husband will worry . 
You speak about sportsmanship against a man who hates you ! 
The protagonists of the scandal competing face to face ! 
- Foolishness ! 
No statement this time and no report . 
An unfortunate story . 
I 'm sorry , I have a bad memory for dates . 
I should 've killed him . 
Same rotten piano . 
Give me my gun ! 
Give me my gun ! 
He died here . 
No mistaking the fatherhood . 
It can 't hurt us to try again . 
My father is dead . 
It almost killed Uncle Ned . 
I 'm not sure he realizes that she 's no longer a child . 
That you 're jealous . 
- to outweigh all the unhappiness of separation . 
- Even Catherine accused you of it - You 're lying . 
- and most ignoble envy of Tom Seymour , he would like to kill him 
No , Khairuzan , I beg you , leave ! 
You 're troubled , master ? 
- Fool . 
- What is this riot ? 
Cavorting in male clothing with a Basranian enemy ! 
Did I perceive threat in the harem wench 's words ? 
What a fool I 've been ! 
But for your wife 's maid , you wouldn 't not celebrate today . 
Why did not Harun win the joust ? 
- It 's too dangerous for you alone . 
Here is the death of an animal . 
Here is the death of an animal . 
Some poor girl waiting for you to come back and you never do . 
You 're very rude and impolite , sir . 
You 're nasty . 
Oh , you kill me . 
Oh , I 've caused you enough trouble , Miss Taylor . 
Bully , bully . 
- What 's wrong ? 
It was all my fault . 
- Oh , he got in trouble . 
That shouldn 't get him in trouble . 
You 're a killer ? 
Shorty 'll kill him . 
Somebody around here is playing murder and for keeps . 
You can 't discourage me . 
We 'd be so scared , we 'd probably take shots at it . 
But only this morning my doctor warned me against sudden shocks . 
- Oh , she 's only trying to scare us . 
So you can figure out when people are cheating you . 
Father , you have just shattered a childhood illusion . 
- Brutal bruising game on the Lord 's day . 
I don 't wanna have any trouble with you . 
- See that Maria keeps out of trouble . 
Why don 't you let Anne do her own dirty work ? 
Don 't you realize this will make her hate her mother ? 
Now , stay out of trouble and kick on third down . 
I 'll smooth out the rough edges if it kills me . 
You 're probably ashamed of this awful dress . 
He 's a fool and a coward . 
I 'm the one who made a fool of you . 
For this , a man would rob his own mother . 
You will answer the question , or be cited for contempt . 
I don 't wanna go to war . 
Madam Duval , I 'm in trouble . 
You see , I made a terrible mistake 10 years ago . 
No , by Godfrey , we 're paying for what 's broke , me and Shane ! 
- It ain 't that bad . 
- Anything wrong with that ? 
You 're dreadful thirsty , ain 't you , Chris ? 
It ain 't that bad . 
Anything wrong with that ? 
No , by Godfrey , we 're paying for what 's broke , me and Shane ! 
- It ain 't that bad .

Maybe it 's that we 're so stupid . 
It 's going to be a longer war than you figured , huh , Duke ?

We lived on the wrong side Of the tracks 
I learned an awful lot in Little Rock 
Nothing 's going wrong this time . 
He had the wrong room . 
You 're wasting time on unrefined persons without money . 
- Mrs. Henry Spofford ill and valet . 
What 's wrong with money ? 
A girl could waste a whole trip to Europe . 
Don 't worry ! 
You just feel that way because he 's poor . 
- He looked kind of grim . 
He can 't be left alone with that blonde man- trap . 
- I 've not had the pleasure . 
Square- cut or pear- shaped These rocks don 't lose their shape

Oh , don 't worry . 
That 's the tragic part , Richard . 
A priest in a slum parish knows all the sadness of the world . 
But the wind never did us any harm . 
- No , no . 
I put you down as a useless man , somebody to lead a cotillion . 
We 're stuck in the block .

You know , after his wife died , he was so depressed ... 
Don 't worry . 
It 's because it 's not that ideal . 
A misunderstanding ? 
Liar ! 
When it will hit you , it will be terrible . 
You shouldn 't feel guilty .

First dead body , ma 'am ? 
Mommy , what 's wrong ? 
You betrayed Odin , didn 't you ? 
You 're here to kill Odin ! 
And that bitch took me out . 
You see what the god of war has come to ? 
She exercises hers with abandon . 
Do or die .

- No , not strong enough . 
This is the worst television set ever made . 
Now , don 't be a killjoy . 
I hope you drop dead at exactly 6 : 30 . 
You don 't look bad yourself . 
I 'm not in love with any other girl . 
- Oh , no , no . 
What 's wrong ? 
Are you tired ? 
I hate jones for a name . 
You don 't fool even punk . 
You 've got it all wrong . 
Clinton , you can 't call us poverty .

You know , education is denied to most people . 
It would only make it worse . 
Child ... oh , mama , don 't be sad . 
A horrible lot of little men . 
Lousy old tubs that ain 't been at sea since WW1 . 
Don 't be scared . 
You would hurt me too much . 
" He thinks he 's unhappy " , I said to myself . 
He 's scared of so many things . 
Maybe I waited for this loneliness of yours for us to talk . 
How many times did you stand here and say you wanted to die ? 
I regret this incident , Mr. Arturo . 
Rumors of his suicide are only natural . 
Why do you hate her so ? 
Enough crying . 
I tried to write , but the pain was intolerable . 
I 've felt insecure for so long . 
And I hurt you ... ... not intentionally . 
And kills the tree . 
Only the living hurt each other . 
The horror will come and leave no trace . 
Mara is in danger , doctor . 
Can someone return with the sole purpose of torturing ? 
You 'll forget this house where we 've made you suffer . 
Stop torturing yourself . 
I knew you wanted to die , but were scared . 
Poor Karin ... 
The damn Punch 
I was so tired . 
Mum has a terrible job . 
- It 's bad , but it does not help . 
You were right not to believe that your mother is dead . 
The old man was real mad . 
If it wasn 't for the memory of your poor father , 
I want to get out of this misery ! 
The devil must have shuffled the cards ! 
I mean , the bad check ? 
You killed him . 
I behaved badly , I lost my temper , but you were so right . 
- Too bad , Slim . 
Cover up for your lousy brother ? 
That 'll bring back my dead father ? 
How was I to know she 'd get so jealous 
Don 't worry . 
Something worse . 
Mrs. Thornburg obviously has quite a problem . 
You wouldn 't have to worry . 
Of course she 'll be fat and ugly . 
They 'd lose that tired feeling in no time . 
I 've had these attacks before and got over them . 
- It 's not very ethical . 
There 's nobody to be jealous of . 
Now , I find he 's a fraud . 
It 's just plain cheating , Dr. Owen , and you know it . 
I have committed no crime . 
You were angry for making you bring me here . 
And you steal a coat . 
Sometimes I 'm awful dumb . 
Cradle robber . 
Hey , you 're in bad shape . 
Just don 't worry . 
Over my dead body . 
It was a lie what you said about sin . 
I 'll worry about mine later . 
Shoot him without mercy ! 
Teodoro , you 're trapped ! 
Choose your death . 
I won 't shoot him , even if you kill me ! 
The enemy . 
It 's dead . 
- You mean that fellow that got hurt ? 
You might as well say stop war because one man got killed . 
Nothing but trouble . 
It 's not confidence , ma 'am . 
You gonna cry ? 
A dollar he 's wrong , coming up . 
I seen him nearly murder a guy once . 
Don 't get hurt , pal . 
Maybe I was jealous . 
To tease a man to death ? 
I was thinking , too bad you 'll lose a good middleweight . 
You look awful tired , kid . 
You 're in trouble , you know that . 
I 've always hated officers ! 
You 're crazy ! 
Galovitch looks like he 's going to murder him .

Danger ? 
When I first saw you there , in that place of bad people , 
lying here , 
In ten years I 've seen many people ... many men , most bad . 
It is over , that bad thing ? 
Stick to your trade or you 'II regret it . 
What wiII become of them if they fail ? 
They 're stealing everything ! 
We 're finaIly out of danger . 
Is it not a splendid voice ? 
Buy this faIlen woman with the money your exploits earned you ! 
No , you 're wrong . 
A mistake for a man perhaps , but for a woman , far worse . 
How could you do something so dreadful ? 
Stick to your trade or you 'll regret it . 
What will become of them if they fail ? 
They 're stealing everything ! 
We 're finally out of danger .

A mistake for a man perhaps , but for a woman , far worse . 
How could you do something so dreadful ? 
Killed ? 
- It can only end in misery ! 
But how would they react if something should go wrong ? 
The war makes people change totally . 
All men are put into forced labour ! 
- Don 't worry , we are back soon . 
It 's all your fault . 
How could you do such a terrible thing to me ? 
When I saw her sad guise - 
I did a terrible mistake . 
Poor thing ! 
I don 't want to have suffered for nothing . 
Miyagi , why did you die ?

The war approaches . 
Without money , there is only misery . 
Finally , out of danger ! 
This virile voice it is not magnificent ? 
I decapitated a hostile general ! 
Otherwise , I will kill myself ! 
But i can 't let you go to your death . 
If you see how much this ghost be horrible , you will be saved ! 
Killed .. ? 
I suppose there 's really only one cure for loneliness .

Heart attacks are very serious . 
You almost die or something ? 
The little boy got strangled . 
We 're looking at negligence or maybe even an accident ? 
We know it was an accident . 
The man is ignoring his child . 
And totally failing . 
- I took you for a thief . - oh ...

It 's a bit of your fault ... 
No regrets . 
But come in , otherwise I 'll think you 're not happy to see me

You claim she is out of danger 
If you don 't follow me , I kill you . 
Your coarseness disgust me and your contact even more so . 
- No - So much for the fear . 
I heard you know the guy , the driver who was in trouble 
Would it have killed you to give it to me earlier ? 
It 's her convent that 's troubling her . 
Don 't do this to me or I would hurt you 
Me neither , but I can help without promising

There 's been enough violence in the ranch . 
That 's one problem when you raise a flock of sons . 
- They killed 40 of my cattle . 
Going to court is a waste of their time and mine . 
I work and eat here and sleeps in these stinking clothes .

Scared to take the plunge ? 
No , no , I 'm not ! 
Something wrong ? 
This is so awful . 
" All your fears are foolish fancy maybe 
- Don 't be angry . 
And stand there helpless . 
If the newspapers get it , it 'll be bad ... 
Because you 're a miserable , lonely , unappy , man . 
- How can a guy that ugly , have sisters ? 
Guilty on both counts ! 
Stop worrying about Mr Wallace . 
I see you 've beaten me to it . 
I 'm not the marrying kind . 
- I 'm not the engaging kind either . 
Now , that didn 't hurt too much , did it ? 
I may come back and fight for the enemy . 
When you 're unhappy , I 'm unhappy . 
How can a guy that ugly have the nerve to have sisters ? 
- Guilty on both counts . 
# Sad to say one day he fell # 
I 'm not the marrying kind .

He was stabbed to death and thrown into the Arno 
In the dirt , it 's hard to tell 
No tricks . 
Sore loser . 
You are everything that I am , plus one more sin : 
Oh , this is unworthy , even from you

He was stabbed to death and thrown into the Arno . 
It 's horrible ! 
The war is over , 
I thought about asking you , but it seemed wrong to me . 
The day after the funeral , the man disappeared . 
His right leg is broken , some bruising , a light concussion . 
- Am I disturbing you ? 
I eat it myself and there 's no doubt 
I just hate to leave ya . 
Go and stop him Stop him

I didn 't kill him . 
Mister , it does everything but shoot around corners . 
I 'd prefer he restricted his speed to his gun ! 
Unfortunately , as I have discovered to my embarrassment , 
But I dare say he would be willing to ... die for Maximilian . 
- No doubt . 
We 'll fool Saint Peter yet ! 
- And our attack failed the last time . 
You will cover us with fire while we assault the gates . 
I didn 't kill him .

An opportunity to get killed would be more accurate . 
Thanks , Mr Andrews , but I 'm not trusting to luck . 
Maybe you don 't hate him . 
I would have died if you hadn 't come back . 
- Why does she hate you so ? 
I don 't think you can make a crime out of that . 
You said I wouldn 't die . 
I 'm too scared , now that you got a gun . 
You 've finally got someone to do your killing for you . 
He 'll put up a fight and get us all killed .

Don 't do anything foolish or dangerous . 
Disappointed they assigned you to a minesweeper ? 
You saw yourself on a carrier or battleship , no doubt ? 
Nonsense . 
- Horrible ! 
And f don 't lose arguments on board my ship . 
I 'm completely at fault . 
Let the fire fall ! 
My headache 's much worse . 
- That one down there on the machine gun ! 
If we go through with this , we 're in trouble . 
Keep that idiot 's face out of my sight ! 
- Not guilty , of course . 
So you ended up by hating Captain Queeg ? 
Captain Oueeg was sick -- mentally ill -- and I had to take over . 
I don 't know what lies have been sworn to in this court . 
And I feel sick about it . 
Queeg was sick . 
From here on , your education must continue in the school of war . 
Don 't volunteer or do anything dangerous . 
- Disappointed it 's a minesweeper ? 
Since you feel so bitter , - 
I don 't lose arguments on my ship . 
Fun but scary . 
Let the fire f all ! 
My headache 's much worse . 
A man can lose his head after what Queeg has gone through . 
It 's a dead end . - we went over it all endlessly . 
- If we do this , we 're in trouble . 
Not guilty . 
- You ended up hating Captain Queeg ? 
Prior to 31 July , did MaryK suspect Queeg of being mentally ill ? 
If criticised , would he feel unjustly persecuted ? 
Lt. MaryK went into a panic . 
No , baby , there are no girls here .

Ah , but what a shame John and Dorothy couldn 't come with us . 
Too bad you want to sell it , though . 
Oh , I don 't think he had such a bad time in Capri , really . 
He wrote them here in Italy , while he was in the war . 
- Even his death . 
You have to fight so hard just to keep afloat . 
You accuse me of criticizing you . 
When I decided to leave my husband , I had no problems . 
Jealous ? 
No , no . 
Ah , this is awful . 
- Not bad . 
It 's an extremely unfriendly community . 
I 'm too tired to count it . 
There 's nothing like champagne . 
There 's no sense to it , no nothing . 
I tried , but I 'm not very good at dealing with Satoko 
I bet Father was disappointed when I was born such an ugly child 
Kikuko has her troubles , too , you know 
It 's in a terrible state now 
That 's your fault , you know ? 
Shuichi always gets drunk there ... he raises hell 
You must be tired 
Are you in pain ? 
She 's not even divorced yet , no wonder she 's upset 
She was crying all last night 
This just proves how heartless you are ! 
It didn 't taste that bad . 
Is she faking it ? 
Father was disappointed , it seems . 
Kikuko 's got her own problems . 
Some death ! 
I 've been bad . 
Maybe if they lived alone he would forget Kinuko . 
Does it hurt ? 
We 're all tired , except the old folks . 
Maybe he feels guilty . 
How cruel ! 
But keeps bad company . 
The point is , this thing is a ship killer ! 
You are from the warship that attacked me , are you not ? 
I would consider that guilty enough . 
An ordinary vessel would 've suffered heavy damage . 
Or destroy it . 
When they failed , they tortured my wife and young son to death . 
What you fail to understand ... is the power of hate . 
Murder means nothing to him . 
Don 't shoot !

Trouble with the Chilkats . 
You 're wrong , Jeff . 
- What 's bad about it ? 
That 's the way people get killed , talking . 
Black- eyed Susans cry 
Why don 't you do something about them killings ? 
Right now , we got an awful lot of money to spend .

Madam would suffer . 
They didn 't steal anything . 
The Master is harassing his managers regarding their accounts . 
Here , it 's above all hell . 
She 's hurt her leg ... while making the trip . 
Poor thing , the road is difficult . 
It 's cruel to abandon me thus ! 
But this is an important lesson : do not marry but a loyal woman . 
Those two were rotten . 
How sorrowful ... how she must be suffering ! 
That 's wrong , it 'll take half a year to get him to pay ! 
And she 's so argumentative 
What 's wrong ? 
No , but lately it 's been hurting constantly 
Let 's leave to avoid the crush

- You also have a temper . 
Perhaps your worst mistake was leaving New Orleans . 
I 'm very tired . 
You want her to go that badly ? 
Very big trouble , drums say . 
Yes , a terrible fault . 
If there 's a way of stopping the ants , I 'll stop them . 
Now I 've destroyed it the same way . 
You weren 't so bad out there yourself . 
Don 't worry about him . 
You realize you could have killed yourself ? 
No problem .

- What an idiot I am . 
And if she doesn 't , she 's not just unlucky , she 's a fool ! 
Poor Cesare , I make you spend all your money . 
- Liar . 
I can 't stand all that nonsense . 
Don 't look at me like some sad victim . 
Recently he 's been going through a crisis . 
That 's not why he 's depressed . 
I 'm always in the wrong , aren 't I ? 
So now it 's my fault ? 
Rosetta Savone committed suicide . 
I 'd prefer to spare myself an unpleasant discussion . 
No , it 's not important . 
It 's a prison , no ? 
Now ain 't you being stupid ? 
- ls it bad ? 
Well , it didn 't do you no harm , did it Frankie ? 
ls that all you could stay out of trouble , two days , dealer ? 
You know you 're no waste . 
- It makes me look bad . 
You think he 's got nothing better to do than to worry about you ? 
Tired ? 
Frankie , go tell Shrika you was fooling , you 'll deal . 
A forced game ? 
Let him kill you . 
No , I 'm not sure at all . 
- It scared me . 
No footprints , no blood , no sign of struggle . 
About as poisonous as a hornet 's . 
No , I 'm not sure at all . 
- It scared me . 
No footprints , no blood , no sign of struggle .

But professor , they were set for minimal destruction . 
It 's so quiet , don 't you think it 's awful ?

You 're dangerous ! 
But , this is a very difficult attack , okay ?

He died in his sleep .

No drugs , no torture . 
It 'll destroy weeks of work .

- Nothing’ s wrong . 
I blew on one of mine and it broke into a million pieces . 
Lousy they was to me , too . 
- No , no . 
- Don’ t mind me crying . 
- She 's just aching for you to , I bet . 
Nothing 's wrong . 
# Ev 'ry time I lose a wrestlin ' match #

He killed me . 
Poor little thing . 
If I ever find him , I 'll kill him . 
Does he still hate me , Doug ? 
A sense of dread that came from nowhere ... 
I heard he dropped dead after a hot set of tennis . 
Did you see the death certificate ? 
The fire 's low . 
You was so drunk , you couldn 't even sort your own cards . 
You 're a dirty , lying coward . 
So you think he made a fool out of you . 
If you stop it , I 'll kill him anyway . 
And we wouldn 't have to worry , not for a minute . 
I didn 't kill my wife . 
I can 't understand why I feel so tired . 
And now , with Mother feeling so ill ... 
I regret , mademoiselle , the long delay . 
Perhaps mademoiselle has mistakenly come to the wrong hotel . 
She will no doubt find you , mademoiselle . 
Mademoiselle must realize that her memory is at fault . 
How could she have died so quickly ? 
I shall present another in our series of situation tragedies . 
But he was in prison when it happened . 
Tim , I 'm so scared . 
I hate that kind of weakness . 
Don 't worry . 
That 's just blind , dumb luck . 
You guys get away with murder . 
That 's the woman who poisoned all those people . 
What have I done that 's wrong ? 
You can 't say that I never took good care of you . 
I 'm afraid I was very much mistaken about brand Z. 
No harm in finding out what it was . 
Sorry to bother you , lady . 
Still you wouldn 't expect to find a corpse lying back of a sofa . 
I told you that woman killed him . 
My husband is staying there , his father 's been sick . 
They 're all tired out . 
I just happened to be passing , and I knew you 'd be tired . 
This dame is rehabilitating me to death . 
The trouble is I haven 't got any money . 
You know , he ain 't such a bad chap after all . 
That 's why I 've been so very worried about you . 
I know , Lyle , but she 's a helpless old woman . 
An idiot can operate it and indeed many do . 
You 're fired . 
All that rain last night , you 'll catch your death of cold . 
Well then , stop beating around the bush . 
I 'm crushed . 
Mr. Dunleavy wants to lose some money . 
Sorry I can 't stay and argue with you , Barney . 
I just worry . 
Now , you see , you 're off to a bad start already . 
Who do you think you 're cheating , anyway ? 
I bet you 're going to go across to that bar and get drunk ! 
It 's a miserable , hot , humid day . 
I don 't kill myself . 
And it 's all my fault . 
This oil is terribly difficult to get rid of . 
Poor baby , you have been working too hard . 
What 's wrong with that system ? 
He 's broke . 
It 's the weakness of the orderly mind . 
" And So Died Riabouchinska . " 
She would bring ridicule on both our country and our President . 
No trains , no fuss , no rush , no bother . 
You depress me . 
You 're heartless , Aunt Rosalie . 
Well , there 's no harm in letting him stay the night , anyway . 
He thinks I 'm going to leave him something when I die . 
I despise decaying things , don 't you ? 
The mourning period 's over . 
No more , Paul , no more . 
No , forget that . 
Really , it 's difficult to know what to do with you . 
That 's an awful lot of money . 
But you said murder ? 
I was asleep ... and a stabbing pain woke me . 
Nevertheless , I 'm miserable . 
Poses you quite a problem , doesn 't it ? 
You know that 's nonsense . 
How does one die ? 
I 'm afraid you 'd find me inadequate . 
I 'll lose my shop . 
Was it accident or murder ? 
She hates me for it . 
That 's all right about the candle , but what about the ghost ? 
Nonsense , it is very simple . 
We thought you were dead . 
The horror of it all . 
I guess I was wrong about you , Ellie . 
You 're just prejudiced . 
It came to me when your father died . 
Look , I don 't mean to be rude or impatient - 
I 'm talking about the person who killed your fiancée . 
You 're just prejudiced . 
The one who was deposed in the riots two years ago ? 
If you 've misunderstood my feelings , I 'm very sorry . 
And it was a bona fide accident ? 
You 're wasting your time . 
That 's what 's so terrible . 
Now , don 't worry . 
If we cannot help you in your trouble , we are sorry . 
No , we want to talk to him alone . 
One murder a night is enough . 
Terrible , isn 't it ? 
Usually the wrong person . 
Scream your head off . 
You 're disgusting ! 
Just got a pain in my back .

Don 't worry . 
I 'm so ashamed , Inspector . 
Not bad . 
You must be tired .

" Conversation Over A Corpse . " 
It would ruin mama 's rug . 
That 's the way I always take those nasty medicines . 
Very sad . 
And the cards are terrible . 
Since I was already a thief , why not go all the way ? 
It 's terribly stuffy , closed up in this dusty television set . 
I delayed the funeral to wait for you . 
Cutter doesn 't have bad news for me . 
But don 't worry , I 'll get his name the next time . 
Birds are stupid . 
No wonder you 're crazy about her . 
A no- good crook and a killer . 
Murder most foul . 
Maybe he couldn 't afford to keep her , so he killed her . 
If I don 't get out of this house , I 'll go mad ! 
No , no ! 
Poor John ! 
No , no . 
And all the time the poor man had a kleptomaniac on his hands . 
And we could go bankrupt . 
My , we 're in a bad mood . 
What 's wrong with him , Doctor ? 
Both of them feel terrible . 
Oh , I hate it , too . 
I 'm sorry to have disturbed you . 
Oh , others are not so considerate . 
Is something wrong ? 
No , no , no ! 
If you 're referring to Burton Reeves , you don 't have to worry . 
You didn 't kill him , Richard , you ruined him . 
He 'll kill me . 
We 're not accusing you of stealing anything . 
He 's a very sick man and a dangerous one . 
No , not even to save my life . 
You had no trouble getting his confession , did you ? 
You will stop this terrible thing . 
You 'd be disappointed . 
What if I fix it so that there can be no possible suspicion ? 
Oh , don 't be ashamed of it . 
Disappoint you ? 
Incredibly enough , I had never been in love before . 
No , no , I was just " the Judge . " 
I saw it coming , but I couldn 't stop it . 
" either in life or after death . 
" and we go our ways , " one of us to die and one to live . 
To other condemned men , 
You 've no idea how much we 're going to miss you . 
You must be starved . 
She poisoned herself instead of you . 
Now , don 't be so skeptical . 
Nasty weather , haven 't we ? 
Oh , no , no , there 's no escape . 
That 's what 's wrong with you , George . 
Ordinarily , but not when it turns out to be a death march . 
And yet , murder it must be . 
That 's too bad . 
Somebody once said that rules were made to be broken . 
I 'm warning you ! 
She is having a hard time with Richard ill . 
I killed Claudia Powell . 
No , no , I insist . 
I haven 't had that worry in a long time . 
The money 's in an abandoned mine shaft . 
I didn 't mean to hurt you ! 
I 'll be dead . 
I was with her at the time of the killing and she knows it . 
Maybe it wouldn 't be a bad idea for you to see one . 
" And the drinks help to drown their doubts .

I didn 't kill her !

Why don 't you get angry at him ? 
When the dosage is as limited as that there 's no danger . 
What 's wrong ? 
She 's dead . 
You 're worried , you 're troubled . 
Without the body , we can 't prove she 's dead . 
You know that Rhoda Forbes that lives down the block ? 
That 's the trouble with a Stetson valve . 
No , just a domestic crisis . 
But I don 't mean no harm . 
I think I found out where the trouble is . 
And they tell me her husband is kind of jealous , too . 
That was a dirty trick you tried to pull before . 
And I didn 't know whether you were hurt or not . 
No , no , he 's much worse . 
What a pity poor Jenkins has already been executed . 
If anyone is obviously guilty , it 's Rodman . 
Something awful . 
What did you think you were gonna get for a murder ? 
Rodman killed his wife . 
The jury found him guilty , and you got a conviction . 
Thus , as it so often happens , a life is ruined . 
Stop worrying . 
No , the boss just called him out on an emergency . 
No wonder so many television tubes are broken . 
This is an emergency ! 
Probably could but it would wreck the door . 
People can be quite vicious once they get the smell of blood . 
No , no , it 's not that . 
It used to worry me that she knew so few people her own age . 
No , don 't bother . 
Oh , Daddy , you look so tired . 
You know , I haven 't broken 90 in years . 
It can destroy everything that we 've got if you 'll let it . 
So what if you lose a few bucks occasionally . 
No , no , you listen , Mrs. Holland , all I want is my 25 bucks . 
No , no . 
That shouldn 't give you any trouble . 
That would have been frightfully unsettling . 
It 's hopeless . 
I was planning on wholesale murder , all right ? 
I was gonna shoot the whole town ! 
Has she threatened you ? 
I get nervous , and then I forget things . 
Except , of course , for the end , when he gets killed onstage . 
Did you say you killed him ? 
I believe you said you killed Count Mattoni . 
He could make it sound terrible in any sort of trial . 
I 'm sorry to disturb you , we shan 't keep you long . 
I killed Mattoni , I didn 't mean to . 
Are you seriously contending that you killed Mattoni ? 
How extremely careless of us . 
Did you say you killed him ? 
Are you seriously contending that you killed Mattoni ? 
Dreary- looking dump , isn 't it ? 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself . 
Manny , no , no . 
Poor Ernest . 
But somehow Minnie always puts me in the wrong . 
About Minnie having an attack ? 
Useful in the fu ... 
No , no , no . 
Murder is rather final , you know . 
I 'm getting terribly behind . 
Twelve murders so far and 11 convictions . 
I killed him . 
Did you say you killed him ? 
Just once more before I die , 
And the bottles are all broken . 
And us with it , dead ? 
No , no ! 
The police are potent so long as they are feared . 
He must have been insane . 
And , oh , yes , then there was the Cistern murder . 
" Since I am unworthy of you ,

Mike got himself into a lot of trouble in New York . 
Very bad . 
Of course I assumed he was guilty . 
He was killed al El Alamein . 
You should have seen the way that corpse was decked out . 
I hate to see you getting all tired and worried like this . 
He committed only the first two murders , not the third . 
Poor people . 
Five minutes ago he tried to kill her . 
Me arrested ? 
Might get the place a bad name , huh ? 
Wrong ? 
A murder , for instance . 
It seems that one of our depositors has been murdered . 
No , no . 
The worst thing that can happen to any of us . 
No , no , no . 
And next night Othello , who strangled her . 
Who 'd kill Withers ? 
Rather pitiful , as a matter of fact . 
I was wrong . 
Look , you don 't need to worry . 
Say , they do look scared , don 't they ? 
And you 're not going to say the wrong things ? 
No trouble at all . 
Now , don 't you worry about that . 
Poor Katherine , she always loses her head . 
Not that there 's anything wrong with the old one . 
If you mean by a customer , I don 't think there 's much danger . 
Don 't worry . 
I 'm so ashamed , Inspector . 
Not bad . 
You must be tired . 
To the biggest sucker in town . 
" Conversation Over A Corpse . " 
It would ruin mama 's rug . 
That 's the way I always take those nasty medicines . 
Very sad . 
And the cards are terrible . 
Since I was already a thief , why not go all the way ? 
It 's terribly stuffy , closed up in this dusty television set . 
I delayed the funeral to wait for you . 
Cutter doesn 't have bad news for me . 
But don 't worry , I 'll get his name the next time . 
Birds are stupid . 
No wonder you 're crazy about her . 
A no- good crook and a killer . 
Murder most foul . 
Maybe he couldn 't afford to keep her , so he killed her . 
If I don 't get out of this house , I 'll go mad ! 
No , no ! 
Poor John ! 
No , no . 
And all the time the poor man had a kleptomaniac on his hands . 
And we could go bankrupt . 
My , we 're in a bad mood . 
What 's wrong with him , Doctor ? 
Both of them feel terrible . 
Oh , I hate it , too . 
I 'm sorry to have disturbed you . 
Oh , others are not so considerate . 
Is something wrong ? 
No , no , no ! 
If you 're referring to Burton Reeves , you don 't have to worry . 
You didn 't kill him , Richard , you ruined him . 
He 'll kill me . 
We 're not accusing you of stealing anything . 
He 's a very sick man and a dangerous one . 
No , not even to save my life . 
You had no trouble getting his confession , did you ? 
You will stop this terrible thing . 
You 'd be disappointed . 
What if I fix it so that there can be no possible suspicion ? 
Oh , don 't be ashamed of it . 
Disappoint you ? 
Incredibly enough , I had never been in love before . 
No , no , I was just " the Judge . " 
I saw it coming , but I couldn 't stop it . 
" either in life or after death . 
" and we go our ways , " one of us to die and one to live . 
To other condemned men , 
You 've no idea how much we 're going to miss you . 
You must be starved . 
She poisoned herself instead of you . 
I was planning on wholesale murder , all right ? 
I was gonna shoot the whole town ! 
Has she threatened you ? 
I get nervous , and then I forget things . 
Except , of course , for the end , when he gets killed onstage . 
I 'm getting terribly behind . 
Twelve murders so far and 11 convictions . 
I killed him . 
Did you say you killed him ? 
Did you say you killed him ? 
I believe you said you killed Count Mattoni . 
He could make it sound terrible in any sort of trial . 
I 'm sorry to disturb you , we shan 't keep you long . 
I killed Mattoni , I didn 't mean to . 
Are you seriously contending that you killed Mattoni ? 
How extremely careless of us . 
Did you say you killed him ? 
Are you seriously contending that you killed Mattoni ? 
Dreary- looking dump , isn 't it ? 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself . 
Manny , no , no . 
Poor Ernest . 
But somehow Minnie always puts me in the wrong . 
About Minnie having an attack ? 
Useful in the fu ... 
No , no , no . 
Murder is rather final , you know . 
Just once more before I die , 
And the bottles are all broken . 
And us with it , dead ? 
No , no ! 
The police are potent so long as they are feared . 
He must have been insane . 
And , oh , yes , then there was the Cistern murder . 
" Since I am unworthy of you , 
And you look tired . 
What did you ever do but stay half drunk most of the time . 
I can prove what I said about Mr. Weems being a very sick man . 
One of the consolations of being ill is the gifts one receives . 
He just broke her neck , that 's all . 
Have they caught the maniac yet ? 
He killed me . 
Poor little thing . 
If I ever find him , I 'll kill him . 
Does he still hate me , Doug ? 
A sense of dread that came from nowhere ... 
I heard he dropped dead after a hot set of tennis . 
Did you see the death certificate ? 
The fire 's low . 
You was so drunk , you couldn 't even sort your own cards . 
You 're a dirty , lying coward . 
So you think he made a fool out of you . 
If you stop it , I 'll kill him anyway . 
And we wouldn 't have to worry , not for a minute . 
I didn 't kill my wife . 
I can 't understand why I feel so tired . 
And now , with Mother feeling so ill ... 
I regret , mademoiselle , the long delay . 
Perhaps mademoiselle has mistakenly come to the wrong hotel . 
She will no doubt find you , mademoiselle . 
Mademoiselle must realize that her memory is at fault . 
How could she have died so quickly ? 
I shall present another in our series of situation tragedies . 
But he was in prison when it happened . 
[ gun firing ] 
I hate that kind of weakness . 
[ crying ] 
Don 't worry . 
That 's just blind , dumb luck . 
( Brooks ) You guys get away with murder . 
That 's the woman who poisoned all those people . 
What have I done that 's wrong ? 
You can 't say that I never took good care of you . 
I 'm afraid I was very much mistaken about brand Z. 
No harm in finding out what it was . 
Sorry to bother you , lady . 
Still you wouldn 't expect to find a corpse lying back of a sofa . 
I told you that woman killed him . 
My husband is staying there , his father 's been sick . 
They 're all tired out . 
I just happened to be passing , and I knew you 'd be tired . 
This dame is rehabilitating me to death . 
The trouble is I haven 't got any money . 
You know , he ain 't such a bad chap after all . 
That 's why I 've been so very worried about you . 
I know , Lyle , but she 's a helpless old woman . 
An idiot can operate it and indeed many do . 
You 're fired . 
All that rain last night , you 'll catch your death of cold . 
Well then , stop beating around the bush . 
I 'm crushed . 
Mr. Dunleavy wants to lose some money . 
Sorry I can 't stay and argue with you , Barney . 
I just worry . 
Now , you see , you 're off to a bad start already . 
Who do you think you 're cheating , anyway ? 
I bet you 're going to go across to that bar and get drunk ! 
It 's a miserable , hot , humid day . 
I don 't kill myself . 
And it 's all my fault . 
Poor baby , you have been working too hard . 
What 's wrong with that system ? 
He 's broke . 
It 's the weakness of the orderly mind . 
" And So Died Riabouchinska . " 
She would bring ridicule on both our country and our President . 
No trains , no fuss , no rush , no bother . 
You depress me . 
You 're heartless , Aunt Rosalie . 
Well , there 's no harm in letting him stay the night , anyway . 
He thinks I 'm going to leave him something when I die . 
The mourning period 's over . 
No more , Paul , no more . 
No , forget that . 
Really , it 's difficult to know what to do with you . 
That 's an awful lot of money . 
But you said murder ? 
I was asleep ... and a stabbing pain woke me . 
Poses you quite a problem , doesn 't it ? 
You know that 's nonsense . 
How does one die ? 
I 'm afraid you 'd find me inadequate . 
I 'll lose my shop . 
Was it accident or murder ? 
She hates me for it . 
That 's all right about the candle , but what about the ghost ? 
Nonsense , it is very simple . 
We thought you were dead . 
[ baby crying ] 
I guess I was wrong about you , Ellie . 
You 're just prejudiced . 
It came to me when your father died . 
Look , I don 't mean to be rude or impatient -- 
I 'm talking about the person who killed your fiancée . 
You 're just prejudiced . 
The one who was deposed in the riots two years ago ? 
If you 've misunderstood my feelings , I 'm very sorry . 
And it was a bona fide accident ? 
You 're wasting your time . 
That 's what 's so terrible . 
Now , don 't worry . 
If we cannot help you in your trouble , we are sorry . 
No , we want to talk to him alone . 
One murder a night is enough . 
Terrible , isn 't it ? 
Usually the wrong person . 
[ crying ] 
You 're disgusting ! 
Just got a pain in my back . 
It might be unwise to disappoint Big Brother .

My husband was most disturbed at your absence . 
Oh , Mark , what a wrong and dreadful thing to say .

You really did kill a man ! 
See if there 's anything Wrong With my face . 
It 's so dangerous , my face Was almost hurt .

It Will be much more dangerous if you go alone .

We 're Barb riders and that 's Barb salt you 're stealing . 
And no need for your gun either , mister . 
I sort of hate to leave you . 
You don 't seem to have much trouble with the Apache , do you ? 
I don 't know who fired the first shot , do you ? 
When Dave 's ma died , I figured the boy needed a tight rein . 
You 're right , he is weak .

Oh , what a pain . 
- Are you still angry ? 
A sick person shouldn 't worry about her appearance . 
" Don 't worry . 
- It would be a waste . 
I got involved too , and you abandoned me . 
I 'm telling you , it 's disgusting ! 
You 'll go bankrupt . 
You made me very unhappy . 
She exploits the fact that you 're sick . 
Too bad you 're leaving us so soon . 
- No , no . 
" My absurd comments provoke ... 
I guess you were thinking of suicide . 
- That 's for lying ! 
I 'm sick , very sick . 
Now you see , Jimmy , why I need money so badly . 
No war is won until a bayonet is put to the throat of the enemy . 
You will attack from 5, 000 feet with 1, 000- pound bombs . 
You kicked 'em where it really hurts . 
- If he did , he 's guilty . 
Hey , this isn 't bad , Frank . 
And you know that he died fighting for a cause . 
[ Crying ] 
By risking their lives in combat in the defense of their country ? 
I 'd rather have the people scared than dead . 
They killed the father , all who worked there ran off ... 
Sometimes I feel you do not trust me . 
No harm will come to you . 
We 'll all die if we don 't get some water soon . 
Are you blind ? 
We live and we die . 
Dirty liar ! 
I have not been a wonderful father . 
Croft , in this mood you are dangerous . 
I am sorry I had to act so bad . 
No , no ! 
It 's dangerous to mess with me . 
There was an idiot causing interference on the line . 
They 've beaten us to it ! 
One of these days , they 'll send you to a forced residence . 
I 'll no take no further steps in my career . 
He was so jealous , you know . 
Don 't worry . 
The poor girl ! 
He nearly got crushed , poor boy . 
The miller 's son , poor boy , was nearly crushed . 
Mrs. Saito is weak . 
But , we aren 't doing anything wrong . 
Damn premature kid ! 
Her parents were killed in the war , when she was a baby . 
But I feel weak . 
I 'm sorry I troubled you , auntie . 
I thought you got worse . 
Don 't be weak . 
Mrs. Saito is weak . 
But we aren 't doing anything wrong . 
Damn premature kid ! 
Her parents were killed in the war , when she was but a baby . 
But I feel weak . 
I 'm sorry I troubled you auntie . 
I thought you got worst . 
What 's wrong with that ? 
It 's the house that 's gotta worry . 
I even saved a couple of you from a murder charge . 
Or maybe that doesn 't worry you . 
He 's gone stubborn on us . 
I told you we 'd be wasting our time , Ed . 
I 've been through one war already . 
Fred , get out of here , this fight is none of your affair . 
It does not make me happy ... ... nor anyone else . 
- lf anything 's happened , it isn 't Ellie 's fault . 
- No , Miss Rhodes . 
Now , don 't you worry about a thing . 
A prison term , huh ? 
- Yes , and they 'll kill you too . 
You grudge me even a proper illness . 
Don 't worry . 
No , no , wait a minute ! 
Every grain of that worthless mineral throw into water and drown 
We 'll rise here to death ! 
And I feel sad ... and I feel like crying . 
Not sorry to be without your jewels ? 
- They 're going to lose their way there ! 
I hurt my Daddy . 
That 's not why you should be sad . 
The steam is choking me ! 
Another 2000 kilometers and it 's fully broken in . 
Oh , shut up , I should be jealous . 
- You 're never happy . 
- This bastard has dragged us around enough . 
- Thank you , but not too strong . 
No , don 't worry . 
Not here , you idiot ! 
I 'd have bet it was man 's work to kill a guy like Scoppo . 
We have only a . 03 % error in azimuth reading .

[ crying ] 
I , Pierre Rouvier , killed my wife , Hélène Rouvier . 
Getting the hell out of here . 
You 'd stop a poor kid from making a living ? 
Given that you hate crowds , you must feel right at home . 
They 're blind and deaf . 
Then 5 minutes later , you 're a bastard . 
- My poor Pierre ... 
M. Rouvier , a cop is always a career bastard . 
At worst 5 , or 6 . 
Horrible . 
- It 's a bad sign . 
He is miserable . 
This cellar is his death . 
Don 't worry , Mme Dinver . 
It 's unfortunate about your husband , Mrs. Hoyt . 
Are you sick ? 
- Oh , poor little girl . 
Officially , I 'm dead . 
- He may be dead . 
He 's being held a prisoner . 
If the British find out , I will have much trouble . 
I regret having to tie up your vessel . 
It 'd be a poor beginning . 
- You 're putting me in an awful spot , you know . 
And my life was ruined ! 
Go away , piss off 
I 'm in trouble , lady . 
Damn you ... 
- Selling stolen goods 
Even a criminal has a sense of shame , I see 
It 's futile looking for him . 
This is gross iniustice ! 
Are you a thieR Were you here to rob or kill someone ? 
But my wife was killed 
The devil is dead 
I 've seen enough of this farce . 
- Go to hell ! 
What the hell is all this about ? 
What a terrible cough ! 
- You 'll kill me ... ? 
Did you move to Africa , after your wife 's death ? 
Nonsense ! 
It was a moment of weakness 
Evey decent man 's son considers himself inferior to others 
And my life was ruined !

Aw , don 't worry . 
- You 're hurting me . 
But my ankle hurts . 
You 're in very bad trouble . 
- This whole thing 's your fault . 
I 'm warning you ! 
Don 't ruin their lives . 
You 'll each say it was your fault . 
Why , I don 't wanna make any trouble for the Navy . 
Too bad you can 't stay around awhile . 
Don 't worry . 
Only thing that - that still gets me is blood and violence . 
Ronker was sick from working too much . 
Hey , you got me all wrong . 
That 's the trouble , George . 
A man could drown . 
Hey , Georgie , are you hurt ? 
Isn 't it terrible about Mr. Dillon ? 
And yell that " damned slave " ! 
It would be a waste of time , because I wouldn 't come . 
- What accident ? 
I 'd regret it more if I stayed . 
There 's no doubt , ma 'am . 
- Accident ? 
Perhaps it 's worse when people wake you up in the first sleep . 
To sum up , it 's all your fault ! 
What a trouble I got into ! 
- You 're wrong , Silvana ! 
Otherwise we 'd get killed . 
Don 't do it , you 'll regret it ! 
- Trouble .

Joan Burton may die . 
They never get things right in prison pictures . 
I hate to bother you , but we 've got a little trouble . 
If they got caught , it 's their own fault . 
He killed me . 
Poor little thing . 
If I ever find him , I 'll kill him . 
Does he still hate me , Doug ? 
A sense of dread that came from nowhere ... 
I heard he dropped dead after a hot set of tennis . 
Did you see the death certificate ? 
The fire 's low . 
You was so drunk , you couldn 't even sort your own cards . 
You 're a dirty , lying coward . 
So you think he made a fool out of you . 
If you stop it , I 'll kill him anyway . 
And we wouldn 't have to worry , not for a minute . 
I didn 't kill my wife . 
I can 't understand why I feel so tired . 
And now , with Mother feeling so ill ... 
I regret , mademoiselle , the long delay . 
Perhaps mademoiselle has mistakenly come to the wrong hotel . 
She will no doubt find you , mademoiselle . 
Mademoiselle must realize that her memory is at fault . 
How could she have died so quickly ? 
I shall present another in our series of situation tragedies .

That 's the woman who poisoned all those people . 
What have I done that 's wrong ? 
You can 't say that I never took good care of you . 
I 'm afraid I was very much mistaken about brand Z. 
No harm in finding out what it was . 
Sorry to bother you , lady . 
Still you wouldn 't expect to find a corpse lying back of a sofa . 
I told you that woman killed him . 
My husband is staying there , his father 's been sick . 
They 're all tired out . 
I just happened to be passing , and I knew you 'd be tired . 
This dame is rehabilitating me to death . 
The trouble is I haven 't got any money . 
You know , he ain 't such a bad chap after all . 
That 's why I 've been so very worried about you . 
I know , Lyle , but she 's a helpless old woman . 
And was that how you were killed in action , sir ? 
- Take it easy and no one 'll get hurt . 
- it 's going to sound a lot worse than it was . 
Nobody 's gonna drop a bomb on you now . 
- But they just kind of scare me , too . 
- There , that 'll ruin you for all other men . 
Not a bad job , either .

This is no sight for sore eyes .

That has to do with our enemy , Mezzacapa . 
How stupid you are ! 
Why shame ? 
I ain 't mad . 
It wouldn 't have hurt you to come to supper . 
- And if he says he is , he 's a liar . 
You don 't have to tell him where you ache or where you pain . 
Come in here and quit beating that drum . 
He had weak hands and nearsighted eyes . 
- Real 's fake . 
Stop sashaying around like a dumb little flirt . 
- He 's a liar and a con man ...

But I 'm not trigger- happy , and I never shot an unarmed man . 
I see you 've got your father 's quick temper too . 
If he 's guilty , he 'll hang . 
Too much of that liniment will make you go blind . 
When you go for your gun ... draw and shoot over your holster . 
I blame it on you !

Was there a man killed in this town last night ? 
He 's been injured . 
I don 't want to scare him off again . 
He couldn 't get much further with an injured leg . 
- Somebody could get killed . 
I 'm sorry to disturb you . 
Maybe she 's hurt and can 't talk . 
I 'm afraid those poor people are in for a terrible blow . 
My aunt has a picture of him that she guards jealously . 
I hate to part with it . 
What 's wrong with me today ? 
Who betrayed us ?

Her Helmut was killed on the River Vistula . 
Well , enough men got killed . 
I often think of it and weep 
You idiot ! 
It wasn 't an illness at all . 
No , he really didn 't have enemies . 
In filming an attack , we got a direct hit . 
His own mother thought he was dead . 
Away from bomb- disposal to the Atlantic Wall . 
That was before the war . 
You 're trying to take the piss out of me . 
No father , no mother , no brother , no sister . 
Anton , I 'm a bit frightened . 
You 'll soon see when you 're dead . 
- He was a poor man . 
Caused by stress and lack of vitamins . 
It wasn 't an illness at all . 
No , he really didn 't have enemies . 
With my illness , I 'm not allowed to work . 
The world is a wicked place . 
No , you scared me on the way here . 
Suppose the Gauleiter sees that , damn it . 
Sabotage , I say . 
Don 't be unfair . 
It 's not a question of fun . 
I 'm scared every time . 
You 're mother 's done everything wrong . 
Wasting his time 
Our grandad has bad eyes . 
It could bring a curse on you . 
Then I 'll ask him if he 's starving and freezing . 
Gentlemen , I think this offer of yours is some misunderstanding . 
I can only reply with personal arguments . 
If I refuse , suddenly we 're not worth anything at all . 
Her Helmut was killed on the River Vistula .

You can 't really hate people , can you ? 
Oh , perhaps I got it wrong . 
You are prisoners now . 
You do bad things , you get shot very quick . 
It is hard to be prisoner . 
You can look after poor Timothy . 
Oh , drop dead . 
Poor little Jane . 
You now die . 
You can 't really hate people , can you ? 
Oh , perhaps I got it wrong . 
He fails at everything he tries . 
Don 't worry , I 'll do it . 
What 's wrong ? 
But I 'm really suffering . 
- Poison ? 
He fails at everything he tries . 
Don’ t worry , I’ il do it . 
What’ s wrong ? 
But I’ m really suffering . 
Fired ? 
I don 't tolerate cheating 
He 's been called worse than that . 
It 's a shame you have to go to the office today . 
You 're jealous . 
However you torture me , 
It 's my fault . 
The business is so bad . 
Didn 't you just say you feared going home . 
Pour the poison ... 
and sweat heavily out of fear ... 
Shit , I won 't be defeated by you . 
What 's wrong with her ? 
Don 't worry , Xu- xian . 
Don 't worry . 
No problem . 
If only we had died together before . 
Xu- xian , it 's all your fault . 
I hate you . 
This thing is gonna kill you some day . 
It 's that damn scarf again . 
- They are miserable . 
They were mistaken ! 
No , no , no , uh , Sharona was always the victim . 
He murdered his wife . 
No , no , no , I told you , Mr. Monk . 
You 're insane ! 
You see what a bad example does , Juan ? 
No , they don 't shine out of worry . 
I 'm not married ... ... l don 't want to make a woman miserable . 
We found no weapons . 
But sooner or later we 'll find those hidden weapons . 
Sister , don 't be sad anymore . 
- Are there weapons in there ? 
Don 't worry about that . 
Arm your people and get to the ruins with them at 3 a . m . 
Coward ! 
Why would I get in trouble ? 
A worker told me the rebels took weapons from here . 
My orders were to bring these prisoners , Captain . 
You 're a coward ! 
- Shoot him , too ! 
There must be no violence during this time . 
Will you let them steal our land ? 
No .. no . 
That 's outrageous . 
Juan Milford didn 't die . 
I saw you crying at during my burial . 
This is insane . 
And the farce worked out . 
Murderer ! 
You failed . 
Revenge . 
Wake up , a thief has entered the house - Thief ! 
Go and commit suicide 
Have you seen the thief ? 
What do you get by insulting me ? 
Actually the shot hit the statue & it fell down killing the mouse 
Who will object , as this is everyone 's problem ? 
The danger is not minimum 
But will you object if we take a photo of the covered dead body ? 
And the mind 's worries go away and it blossoms . 
I 'm afraid it isn 't just a dead body . 
Madness . 
You 're ignoring the fact this wasn 't a normal body . 
Ugh . 
All the Los Angeles circuits are dead . 
There 's been an accident . 
They 'll destroy you ! 
I 'm afraid it isn 't just a dead body . 
Madness . 
You 're ignoring the fact this wasn 't a normal body . 
Ugh . 
All the Los Angeles circuits are dead . 
There 's been an accident . 
They 'll destroy you ! 
You 're fired as of now . 
No , forget it . 
- I thought she was dead . 
Reject file . 
You make me lose my breath without racing . 
Honey , it 'd be rugged sometimes , dangerous sometimes . 
An idiot can operate it and indeed many do . 
You 're fired . 
All that rain last night , you 'll catch your death of cold . 
Well then , stop beating around the bush . 
I 'm crushed . 
Mr. Dunleavy wants to lose some money . 
Sorry I can 't stay and argue with you , Barney . 
I just worry . 
Now , you see , you 're off to a bad start already . 
Who do you think you 're cheating , anyway ? 
I bet you 're going to go across to that bar and get drunk ! 
It 's a miserable , hot , humid day . 
I don 't kill myself . 
And it 's all my fault . 
Poor baby , you have been working too hard . 
What 's wrong with that system ? 
He 's broke . 
It 's the weakness of the orderly mind . 
" And So Died Riabouchinska . " 
She would bring ridicule on both our country and our President . 
No trains , no fuss , no rush , no bother . 
You depress me . 
You 're heartless , Aunt Rosalie . 
Well , there 's no harm in letting him stay the night , anyway . 
He thinks I 'm going to leave him something when I die . 
The mourning period 's over . 
No more , Paul , no more . 
No , forget that . 
Really , it 's difficult to know what to do with you . 
That 's an awful lot of money . 
But you said murder ? 
I was asleep ... and a stabbing pain woke me . 
Poses you quite a problem , doesn 't it ? 
You know that 's nonsense . 
How does one die ? 
I 'm afraid you 'd find me inadequate . 
I 'll lose my shop . 
Was it accident or murder ? 
She hates me for it . 
That 's all right about the candle , but what about the ghost ? 
Nonsense , it is very simple . 
We thought you were dead . 
[ baby crying ] 
I guess I was wrong about you , Ellie . 
You 're just prejudiced . 
It came to me when your father died . 
Look , I don 't mean to be rude or impatient -- 
I 'm talking about the person who killed your fiancée . 
You 're just prejudiced . 
The one who was deposed in the riots two years ago ? 
If you 've misunderstood my feelings , I 'm very sorry . 
And it was a bona fide accident ? 
You 're wasting your time . 
That 's what 's so terrible . 
Now , don 't worry . 
If we cannot help you in your trouble , we are sorry . 
No , we want to talk to him alone . 
One murder a night is enough . 
Terrible , isn 't it ? 
Usually the wrong person . 
[ crying ] 
You 're disgusting ! 
Just got a pain in my back . 
Then let the Hebrews die ! 
Your husband is in the House of the Dead .

What is the death of one slave to us ? 
Why did you kill for me , Nefretiri ? 
She 's dead ? 
And when he was troubled , was it your heart that ached for him ? 
There is only sorrow here . 
Beauty is but a curse to our women . 
That before death closed my eyes , 
The very dirty one there . 
Think of us and stop hearing the cries of your people . 
let them look upon what you thought unworthy . 
Imagine poor Nefretiri not knowing in which bed she will sleep . 
He could be dangerous . 
You can overcome anything ... but your own arrogance . 
You are the only thing I regret leaving . 
Is the holy mountain forbidden to men ? 
I have brought more evil upon you . 
I cursed you , not him , because I love you . 
There is no shame in this . 
Death cometh to me 
There will be no new world and no blood on this door . 
The war crown . 
Better to die in battle with a god than live in shame . 
Abandon it ! 
You couldn 't even kill him .

- She 's dead ? 
There is only sorrow here . 
Beauty is but a curse to our women . 
- No , not that one , the very dirty one . 
lf they reek , it 's with the stench of injustice . 
Think of us , and stop hearing your people 's cries . 
Before you go , let them look upon what you thought unworthy . 
I warned you of his treason , my father . 
- to slave and suffer in dumb anguish , - 
- beaten into the dust from which he came , - 
No doubt you can overcome anything ... but your own arrogance . 
You are the only thing I regret leaving . 
Did the little boy die in the desert , my father ? . 
They told me you were condemned .

Mr. Andrea , poor soul , was alone . 
The floor .. is really in bad shape , it 's filthy . 
That poor man almost had a stroke . 
What a pain , my child ! 
I 'll kill you ! 
You almost broke my finger ! 
Of course , he has to get by someteimes , the poor soul . 
No , no , let 's call it quits . 
We 're spending our first fake 10 . 000 lire . 
Oh , poor dog , I 'm so sorry . 
Of course , a guard who arrests his own father is a golden guard . 
At least , this time you didn 't make us waste time . 
It 's him who arrested me ! 
- Do you know he was quite discouraged ? 
Tell me , how did you know .. that the bill was fake ? 
They give me terrible gas . 
You 're the one who 's blind . 
I 've never been so tired in my life . 
The yelling and the hitting and the dirty names . 
I mean , I told you I was tired and everything . 
They give me terrible gas .

He says it not for a honest woman . 
You scared me ! 
No , no . 
And punished you . 
Our enemies dread us because of this . 
If he 's late he will lose his job . 
He wouldn 't have hurt him . 
This is not good enough ! 
He 'd be capable of any horrors , of the worst atrocities ! 
- Too bad , it was the last run . 
Perhaps it 's the loneliness . 
" Little girl kidnapped by maniac " . 
- Sorry , wrong number . 
The owner is not around anymore , he died three days ago . 
( Stolen , of course ) .

Then came the morning when the pain had left him . 
It 's bound to hurt at first , I expect . 
- Nonsense . 
Well , let 's say we fought the battle together . 
Anyway , I 've got no more legs to lose ! 
- Have any trouble ?

Over this feast of fools 
And abandoned me without love 
This worthless minstrel ? 
ls it my fault that I 'm normal ? 
One for hell 
I 'm not a man to trust 
It 's my prison , my homeland 
Making a fool of me tearing me apart , haunting me 
No need for gold nor for jewels 
All the thieves all the rogues 
You 'll see them drink ' til they 're dead drunk 
No need for gold nor for jewels 
Quasimodo is miserable 
You will find her in the prison of La Sante 
Violated children 
Violated children 
And death 
Distracted from prayer , I opened the blind 
The hell that you 'll go to will be mine as well 
The man who cheated on you is not the same 
To make you hate me so much ? 
It 's a nasty world out there 
God this life is cruel for two searching hearts 
I don 't want to die 
Die 
Far from the misery of the world

They talk fast but fight slow . 
Let me look at your ugly face . 
- It 's been plain murder . 
- The devil with Timmer . 
I feel it 's wrong that one of them wasn 't . 
- But he 's had his war , too . 
You mean that practical nurse who killed all those people ? 
Those pieces from the Pacific during the war . 
My poor little Claude , what did I do to you ? 
Claude was dead . 
Not even partway , she can 't fool me . 
No doubt . 
I thought I might ... try a murder- mystery during the evenings . 
On this not- too- merry but disputed point , I 'll take my leave . 
Why didn 't I die in the orchard ... and end the agony there ? 
I know you killed him , so there 's no sense lying . 
These things are so important to me now that he 's dead . 
How could I be so blind ? 
She seemed a bit upset over the accident to the Daigle boy .

The mess sergeant here has a problem . 
I must have killed a million of these bugs single- handed . 
That was crazy shooting ! 
Get the ambulance and crash wagons to stand by . 
Words do not carry the greatest tribute , my son . 
Is he very bad ? 
But it 's bad 
Thought you were lying 
Too bad for Sugiyama 
Don 't worry . 
Too bad about Miura 
I said , just to make him mad 
Of course , I argue too always fighting 
Your father acted worse 
It 's foolish to be so jealous 
J ust don 't make me worry 
What 's the harm ? 
No harm done . 
I 'm sorry I made so much trouble . 
What are you shooting at , you fool ? 
He 's even lost the need for violence . 
I think he killed the lion defending himself . 
What the hell do you see in her ? 
And now I 'm completely and utterly depressed . 
Hold on or you 'll die ! 
The destruction will be incalculable . 
He will die at the hands of his own invention . 
But pain make man think .

Neither does my contempt . 
Don 't be depressed . 
It was a bad connection . 
Mr and Mrs Macabee have just been cited for contempt of congress . 
Don 't worry about that . 
His Majesty King Shahdov has been through a bloody revolution . 
Nonsense ! 
They were by no means hapless . 
You must have hated me .

Personally , when I 'm dog- tired , I can sleep on the floor . 
Illegal ? 
I make these Madison Avenue fellas unhappy . 
- He broke my jaw . 
Lonesome Rhodes , rah- rah- rah ! 
Our very own Lonesome Rhodes . 
Dick Nixon either . 
I could murder them like this : 
I 'm poison . 
Ain 't it a shame how they get on you about everything ...

Our very own Lonesome Rhodes . 
He 's stupid , he 's got no mentality , he thinks with his feet . 
I could murder them , like guests . 
All of a sudden , I 'm poison . 
Look how you 'll end up , you lousy whore ! 
I 'm sick . 
Everyone has a secret agony . 
Open your heart to the suffering , O Holy Virgin ! 
" I 'm wealthy , but I 'm alone and unhappy . 
What a waste ! 
I almost drowned once . 
" I would be devastated if I had to turn him down . " 
He had a harsh , anxious expression . 
" and preach to these people about sin and redemption ... 
I didn 't worry too much about it . 
And I left him to his dismay and his distress . 
I learned that , upon Visconti 's death ... 
A few days later he felt bad about it .

To remind people of death . 
That makes people angry . 
Scared after all ? 
No man can live with Death and know that everything is nothing . 
And you 're a poor wretch 
Surprised that I steal from the dead ? 
Now I understand these ten wasted years . 
So He sent you to poison my master 's mind . 
It 's logical to kill you , too . 
Got a bad conscience ? 
We worry about so much . 
To believe is to suffer . 
It 's hell with women and hell without . 
Tears and whining . 
It hurts all the same . 
Kill me . 
It 's a dirty mess . 
The Devil is with her . 
Utterly useless ! 
- That 's Death ? 
- To remind people they will die . 
- Despite that , you don 't want to die . 
- It 's worse than that . 
- With that stinking brew ? 
I steal from the dead . 
Don 't turn Your face from us in contempt - 
- Did you think it was bad ? 
- It 's not so much fun , I can tell you . 
- One worries so much . 
- You are quite arrogant . 
Tears , complaints and laments by the sackfull . 
- But it hurts anyway . 
I 'm really sorry if I harmed you , but I have such a temper . 
He has to provoke me so I get angry like before . 
He 's absolutely dead . 
It 's mad , that 's what it is . 
- She has the Devil with her . 
I can 't be bothered , I can 't be bothered ... 
I said it 's meaningless . 
- And this is Death .

With that stinking muck ? 
I suddenly understand the meaning of those ten wasted years . 
You 've turned thief . 
Don 't stand there gaping , damn it ! 
Guilty conscience ? 
I suppose you sat boasting about your angels and devils . 
People have such troubles these days . 
It 's hell with women and hell without them . 
Sobbing and moaning to wake the dead . 
If everything is imperfect in this imperfect world , 
Yes , but first I have to kill him . 
The devil is with her .

I suppose if I were you ... ... l 'd have to kill myself . 
I tell you , gentlemen , we have a problem on our hands . 
So you changed uniforms with a dead man . 
It 's taken an awful beating .

One of the men took sick this morning , sir . 
I say , gentlemen , we have a problem on our hands . 
You see , the available forces have been badly distributed . 
It 's taken an awful beating . 
- Clipton , we 're facing a crisis . 
His arm 's infected . 
No , no ! 
How often you hear people say that because of some woe ... 
Maybe cry for myself . 
You want to appear worse than you are .

Didn 't you say you had lots of time to kill ? 
Excuse me for offending you , earlier .

So fill these lonely arms of mine 
Oh , you let me worry about that . 
His father died , you should look after him . 
You 'll starve to death . 
Shyam , remember how you found a lame sparrow as a kid . 
.. and a poet lost in the poetry are so stunned . 
Why such a sad song on this occasion ? 
Don 't worry . 
I don 't want to suffer again . 
I 've made no mistake . 
Don 't deceive yourself . 
You never understood that ; that 's why you are unhappy . 
Without you my life is meaningless . 
These fragile bodies , these vain faces . 
Waste paper sold for ten annas . 
I can only make you suffer . 
So you aren 't dead . 
The enemies of humanity , this world of rituals . 
This world which is distraught and full of trouble . 
A world where death is cheaper than life . 
After his father died , you should look after him . 
Don 't worry , mother . 
You 'll starve to death . 
Shyam , remember how you found a lame sparrow as a kid ? 
Why such a sad song on this occasion ? 
Don 't worry . 
I don 't want to suffer again . 
I loved you , but you were poor and unemployed . 
Don 't deceive yourself . 
You 've never understood that ; that 's why you 're unhappy . 
" Without you , life is meaningless " 
" Slake the thirst that lies deep in my soul " 
No ! go away ! 
" These fragile bodies , these vain faces " 
Waste paper sold for ten annas . 
I can only make you suffer . 
So you aren 't dead . 
" The enemies of humanity , this world of rituals "

You think I 'm rather useless , don 't you ? 
When the catch is bad , it 's sad . 
I hate leaving here . 
- That and Carson 's death . 
How awful . 
- Poor man . 
- An accident ? 
The murderer confesses , I suppose . 
Were you jealous of Hilary Carson ? 
No , it 's the reasoning of a man who has no time to lose . 
It makes me sick . 
Because I 'm bad at advertising myself . 
Do you want to make me angry ? 
I 'm a poor woman struggling to make ends meet . 
What a mess ! 
- Nervous types ... sometimes agitated . 
- I 'm very tired . 
It 's a shame . 
Dead ? 
No , Howard didn 't betray anyone . 
Instead of killing him , if you had crossed the street ... 
" The secret war continues . 
You don 't give a damn , do you ? 
When he saw me , he lost his mind and took some poison .

I hate you ! 
It 's embarrassing ! 
What a terrible thing to happen ! 
It 's because she 's ill . 
Shinkichi ... you 've gone mad . 
It has spots , so it is evil , kill it ! 
Pulling this rickshaw will be the death of me . 
- Master Wong , sorry to disturb you . 
Come on , attack my throat , harder . 
I think there 'll be war soon . 
Don 't worry . 
The devil rules hell ... 
The trouble is even though I can fight , 
We wouldn 't kill our own people . 
I 'm punished for this ? 
- Arrest them , go ! 
It 's all a deception ! 
Come and fight me if you dare ! 
Do you want to die ? 
Guardian of Anger ! 
Evil being ! 
I 'm going to die this time . 
It hurts , it really hurts . 
- Arrest the rebels ! 
I 'm too tall to die . 
I hate them . 
Self- destruction . 
No , believe me , nobody 's trying to make a fool ... 
Because when I tried to be bad , 
You mustn 't get mad , though , when ... 
- No , no , we 're not ! 
Doesn 't hurt . 
- I 'm sorry , but you see , I 'm nerVous . 
Maybe I got you figured all wrong . 
All right , fat mouth , why don 't you show me where I 'm wrong . 
Because nobody 's gotta get hurt . 
Now , don 't touch that gun unless you intend to shoot somebody . 
He 's lying . 
Bad trouble . 
Fact number one , it was an accident . 
You 're a liar , Mike Damon . 
What we have witnessed in an insult to all Polish railway men ! 
Have you had any cases of sabotage , Comrade Tuszka ? 
The problem this time was that I had no ticket . 
We have problems with Orzechowski . 
What we have witnessed in an insult to all Polish railway men !

He looks half- dead . 
Would I consider going AWOL ? 
- I only asked you to make him jealous . 
But why must you worry about every little detail , Lewis ? 
- No , no . 
It ain 't so bad . 
Cab , bomb , dysentery , it 's all the war . 
At the Onyx they drown out the trumpet . 
It can 't do any harm at this stage . 
I don 't even know what I 'm crying about . 
Two thousand war workers . 
- What 's very bad taste ? 
And it was not a thing of beauty . 
A short man , a short temper . 
All right , so you had a bad time . 
Let 's get so drunk they think we 're Army fliers . 
The direct cause of death is a fractured forehead . 
Don 't worry . 
- Don 't waste my time . 
And you ruined it for us . 
I know you gave an order to kill PARK . 
Shit ! 
And that you have CHO hiding who killed PARK and Dong- jik . 
Damn . 
Don 't worry . 
Fuck . 
If that 's what it takes to bust those who killed my brother ... 
Don 't cause trouble . 
He assaulted you and YANG for not confessing . 
When we were investigating a cold murder case ... 
You 're only a criminal !

That man 's been following me and I want him arrested . 
Boy , what a killing .

You could lose it or someone might steal it . 
The morse code idiot ! 
Return after the war . 
Ready to kill more Germans ?

Dick Avery started working on the pictures . 
That 's sinister enough . 
It 's movingly dismal . 
You put yourself in the wrong place . 
Nonsense . 
I 'm afraid it 's all my fault . 
You 're furious at Tristan .

I hate to interfere in these little family squabbles . 
No , thank you , I prefer being in distress . 
She cries a little ... and there you have your shower . 
- Scandal ? 
I give you my word , if anything else happens , I 'll go insane . 
No , Miss Prescott , you mustn 't say that .

You insane brutes rest . 
Sir , it 's practically a poison . 
You know you have wicked thoughts all the time , Mr. Simmons . 
Then a machi ne gun mowed him down and a bomb fell on him . 
You know you have no cousin Horace who was killed in the war . 
There 's no doubt about it , Perrin . 
You liar 
You 've just done me a terrible injustice . 
Jocko , he 's gonna kill us all . 
Don 't turn your back on those thieves in Medicine Bend . 
Don 't be a fool , Rafe . 
You are always sad . 
No , no , in the closet . 
He is very tired . 
The old fool will say nothing . 
It is about the men who are imprisoned . 
Sergeant , this is a dangerous place for a civilian . 
I regret officiaI duties made me so Iate . 
They 've arrested Paco . 
Stop wasting time , Iet 's get it over with . 
Sergeant Garcia , you are a disgrace to the military profession . 
That my chest can 't hold another single one , I fear 
You die . 
Why should the ocean make you ill ? 
Get out of the way , you stupid fool ! 
I fail to comprehend that he has committed any crime . 
Zorro is no fool . 
He fought bitterly to the very end . 
True , but somehow , I don 't feeI so bad about that . 
Crowds of angry peons are gathering , mi Comandante . 
Ah , you are too frightened to talk , eh ? 
The Eagle is quite displeased with you . 
Then what are these problems you are talking about ? 
Did you hurt yourself ? 
This is for your trouble . 
It seems they intend to destroy him . 
Have the prisoners anything to say in their defense ? 
It is all your fault , Senor Zorro . 
No tricks , amigos . 
But you have no prisoners at all . 
- As a pompous fool . 
Even our lancers have been powerless against him . 
- Of the worst sort . 
I 'm flattered , but the Comandante is suffering from a delusion . 
Can you not identify this prisoner as Zorro ? 
Shut up , you idiot ! 
No , no , no . 
Zorro is dead . 
Why worry ? 
Anyone could have fired the shot and put the musket in his hands . 
By finding the one who is guilty , of course . 
- I would have killed her . 
So it was Esteban Rojas who killed the Comandante ? 
Oh , too bad . 
The wicked will pale at the sight of your frown 
So Zorro is brought to a horrible end 
He broke it over my body . 
Notice the strange way in which the barbs are cut . 
Then there is no mistake , senor . 
- Scared you , didn 't I ? 
I wouldn 't Iike to think you were neglecting it . 
Look , I am a horse thief . 
- Put that knife away , you idiot . 
What 's wrong ? 
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself . 
Was anyone injured in the fire ? 
I don 't think anyone was hurt . 
It 's wrong to hide Iike this . 
What 's the matter , are you deaf and dumb ? 
And you wiII regret that you did not cooperate . 
WeIl , that 's most unfortunate . 
I can be just as stubborn as you . 
A terrible thing . 
Oh , you Iittle devil . 
Everywhere we go , the peons are angry . 
They have him Iocked in a ceII with no Iight and no air . 
He said you were in some sort of trouble with the peons . 
But I did not think Castenada would be completely without honor . 
We have no weapons , Joaquin . 
He meant no harm by it , Joaquin . 
- Kind of wet and kind of stupid . 
No ， no ! 
Yours is a fool 's sacrifice ， Michael . 
I 'm sorry to have troubled you . 
The police think you murdered her , don 't they ? 
Oh , don 't worry , Doc . 
Is she dead ? 
Oh , you fool . 
If Windsor knows what I think he knows , then he can ruin me . 
Troubles ? 
I tell you two strange men have a wreck . 
Was he nervous or upset ? 
The dirty , stinking animal ! 
Kill the wind . 
Then who killed him ? 
Since when is dancing this crazy jumping ? 
But I 'm just a coward when it comes to doing it . 
No wife , no bambini . 
It 's a beating report . 
Not a bad- looking guy . 
What can you lose ? 
She 's been in her room for hours crying . 
A whore is found guilty if only she is caught in the bed 
Don 't worry 
I wasted eight years 
Ignore her ! 
But Tung Sing did it , you 've approached a wrong person 
He was so careless to lose his wallet 
You 've approached a wrong guy I haven 't practiced that for ages 
Sir , they are the mom and sister of the dead 
Chan Ho Nam , you disappoint me ! 
But you 'll lose your reputation ! 
Chick , to hell with you ! 
To hell with you ! 
What 's wrong with you ? 
It 's tragic the others died in the moment of their glory . 
He died here , after the ship crashed . 
That poor dog must have jumped him first . 
And that candle 's burning lower and lower .

No errors ?

Right or wrong , people will talk , and so ... 
Are you in trouble ? 
You 've been crying .

Go , now there is no danger . 
Your Iife is in danger . 
You have ruined months of hard work . 
No one ruins his own house . 
Destroy this bridge !

And I’ m tired of hearing about that ... 
You 'd lose your meal ticket , wouldn 't you ? 
Ah , it 's always a mess after a killing . 
He broke his vow and rode away to Tombstone .

He 's the worst killer on the frontier , that 's what about him .

My brother is mad . 
It was awful . 
I 'm sorry I got upset . 
Fool . 
Behind the abandoned warehouse by the canal . 
Takeda isn 't dead . 
I 'm not like the guy that you beat to death . 
I began to fear we had lost the gay person I knew in Paris . 
I 'm terribly sorry for being so late . 
That is very sad . 
- That 's worse . 
The decorations hideous , the music a catastrophe . 
My dear fellow , there is no need to panic . 
I fear I do not altogether understand you . 
Oh , no , no , no . 
Oh , that poor Hungarian ! 
I got a solemn word of warning for you . 
I understand his valets are having trouble with his shaving . 
I fear so , sir . 
I 'm afraid Miss America has missed the boat . 
It 's a shame , she 's going to hate missing all this . 
But Grandmother isn 't going because she 's tired . 
- This may mean a scandal , Northbrook . 
That is your considered suggestion for surmounting this crisis ? 
An hour is hopeless . 
It will answer those stupid American protests . 
Nonsense . 
Poor darling , do you feel so terribly disconcerted ?

Don 't punish my child . 
You 're punishing my brother !

You are so broken hearted just because an ox died ? 
He 's killed me ! 
I say , murderer ! 
You are very arrogant ! 
The kids are starving and you live off your wife ! 
Don 't worry my queen . 
But very difficult to follow . 
I 'm very annoyed with you ! 
Give my share of the money or I 'll ruin the entire house ! 
Taking his temper out on me ! 
Both of you trouble me a lot ! 
Who says you trouble us ? 
You look at him and feel jealous ! 
No my child , throw this gun away ! 
She sent her son to kill me ! 
Nobody but you can stop him .

You 're hurting Hiroko 's feelings . 
These people want war . 
Failing to do so , will be the end of our human race . 
Without weapons , what can we do against them ? 
We shall attack . 
I hate to have to sacrifice Etsuko and Hiroko . 
But I can 't stop the attack . 
Speak of the devil . 
Maybe we 've been fooling them . 
I was very sorry to hear of his accident . 
Have I done something wrong ? 
I 've shown you some of its power and some of its danger . 
You know , the devil has something here . 
You 'll hurt Mr. Meek 's feelings . 
Those of us who believe that ... evil is good ... and good evil . 
You know , the devil has something here . 
Maybe we 've been fooling them . 
I was very sorry to hear of his accident . 
You 'll hurt Mr. Meek 's feelings . 
You 're wasting your time , Paul . 
I can 't explain , but it will not be safe here . 
I lost my temper . 
- No , no . 
I can 't harm you . 
Now he 's dead , so it doesn 't matter . 
Your fault . 
Destroyed in a moment .

Don 't Iook so depressed , Katerina . 
What were you so scared of ? 
- What 's so bad about it ? 
I hate to do it . 
No , there 's someone else who is to blame for this . 
WeIl , no use crying over spilt milk . 
It 's my fault , I deserved it . 
Don 't worry about that for now . 
A tooI and die maker . 
So that was your fault ? 
No , we go where no one bothers us . 
Don 't worry , I earn much more than your mother does . 
Don 't bother me ! 
I don 't care a damn about prestige or stupid fashion . 
She 's in a very bad mood today . 
- My father 's dead ! 
Yes , but he doesn 't have any faults . 
Is anything wrong ? 
After all , it 's war ... 
She probably thinks we 're all dead . 
- Five days under arrest ! 
What 's wrong ? 
It 's my fault ... 
You 're always so irritable , always criticizing .

Is your rheumatism worse again ? 
A lame man going to enlist !

You must be tired . 
The hop business has been badly hit by the war ! 
What do I need that kind of trouble for ?

The prosecution calls Mrs. Constance MacKenzie to the stand . 
- He 's disappointed for me . 
- It wasn 't her fault . 
And I think most of it 's mid- Victorian nonsense . 
I 'll prove everything your mother ever said was wrong . 
You 're wasting your time , Mike .

Don 't worry . 
It 's her revenge . 
No harm done . 
I almost killed myself . 
I 'll leave you in your prison .

You spoilt my meal ! ... ' cause we don 't waste enough money . 
Does she think she scared us ? 
Before the accident . 
What a whine ! 
But you argue with everybody ! 
All his fault ... 
What a couple of losers we are . 
What 's wrong about it ? 
- Are you getting mad ? 
Don 't be stupid , let 's both go and see what comes out of it . 
Piss off ... 
Don 't choke ! 
Giovanna , you misunderstood me ! 
Nonsense !

At your age , no more fooling around ... 
But then mum died and the bottle stayed sealed . 
And don 't die tonight ! 
What a stupid face ! 
- You are so rude ! 
If you don 't stop it , I 'll leave !

Why did you want to kill yourself ? 
Didn 't you think about your mom 's weak heart ?

I would leave it to you , but it 's my poor mum 's . 
Don 't hit my face or I 'll kill you !

Wasting your time throwing stones in the water !

I 'm being so stupid . 
It 's the first time one 's done damage .

Joking , I 'm now in hell . 
I know you are broke . 
No money paid even killing you . 
I am a thief , you are a pawner . 
Then you 'll die of hunger . 
You don 't have to be scared . 
See the Buddha in the hell .

Back before my bitol organs were poisoned by alcohol , 
Don 't be so discouraged . 
In other words , all pain will pass with death . 
When you die and go over to that world , you 'll see the Buddha . 
Hell , you think I 'm gonna clam up in front of the magistrate ?

I know you 've had a quarrel , and it 's made you unhappy . 
If we discuss it , you could be wrong . 
- Hey , this is sure one hell of a story , Dave . 
- Please , Bama , it 'd just kill me . 
Assault ! 
Assassination attempted ! 
I 'm afraid that I 'll lose you one day . 
We 're starving ... come on , let 's stay over . 
You could die terribly . 
Where are you going , evil spirit ? 
Shui Tianjiao , stop killing . 
For practising witchcraft , you 're condemned to exile . 
Poor Hsu Hsien ! 
Could she be the serpent I had to abandon when I was a child ? 
Venerable Hokai , why do you hate me so much ? 
Damn serpent ! 
We will have to fight ! 
How stubborn !

No cheating : 
He 's jealous . 
Don 't worry . 
Damn it ! 
No one will miss you . 
We are too tired . 
What 's the problem ? 
He walks by night unconsciously and hits me brutally . 
It 's my destiny to suffer in deep solitude . 
Go back to work , idiot . 
Drop dead ! 
Is he dead ? 
The punishment has come .

Don 't you ever worry about anything ? 
But people die or leave us . 
Quite right , but wars start a little behind the times . 
Small men are worse than useless . 
You 've got it all wrong , Lopez . 
- Am I in disgrace ? 
Don 't worry . 
Owing to extreme danger ... 
Why have him killed ? 
Spying is a dangerous profession . 
- It looks as if I 'm dangerous to work for . 
Don 't worry . 
Others are outraged by it . 
You 're dangerous now . 
- Perhaps you have a weak head . 
- Blind ? 
You broke my pipe .

I 'll cry no doubt 
By facing a life sentence in prison 
Let this war go to the dogs ! 
Your slave- drivers torture those who try to escape 
The lazy dogs refuse to move ! 
I hate being either aggressive or defensive . 
I assumed this meant no special danger 
Here they have no mother ... no wife ... and no children 
They 're the sick ones 
You fool ! 
Does this man 's death mean that we may also die ? 
Do you feel no shame ? 
You must be tired 
You 're wrong ! 
It 's too pitiful ... to sell those men ! 
It 's stolen property ! 
Remove your dirty feet when speaking to me ! 
They 'll be exploited and later killed 
Nothing can come of it as long as there is a war going on 
You did it because he made you lose face in front of others 
Despite the dilemmas which come of our being at war , 
No one wishes to risk dangers to break out ? 
Why not be honest ? 
ls Jin Tung Fu in ? 
I 'm having trouble ! 
Jin Tung Fu is some woman , eh ? 
Kill the rat ! 
Don 't worry ! 
There 's no mistake ? 
I 'm beaten already . 
Tell him it 's dangerous tonight . 
lf you betrayed us ... you 'll die ! 
Go to sleep ... you needn 't worry ! 
Michiko , don 't torture me ! 
You fail because you think it 's a human head . 
You 're a hopeless one . 
It worries you ? 
We need a new leader for the prisoners . 
I 'll cry no doubt . 
Is something wrong ? 
By facing a life sentence in prison . 
Let this war go to the dogs ! 
Your slave- drivers torture those who try to escape . 
The lazy dogs refuse to move ! 
I hate being either aggressive or defensive . 
Ill ? 
I assumed this meant no special danger . 
They 've steamed to death . 
I am only authorized to detain you . 
Here they have no mother ... no wife ... and no children . 
They 're the sick ones . 
You fool !

Your mother ... is she still ill ? 
There 's more of a profit in it but it 's more dangerous . 
Is Jin Tung Fu in ? 
I 'm having trouble ! 
Hey , Jin Tung Fu is some woman , eh ? 
Kill the rat ! 
Don 't worry ! 
There 's no mistake ? 
I 'm beaten already . 
Tell him it 's dangerous tonight . 
If you betrayed us ... you 'll die ! 
Go to sleep ... you needn 't worry ! 
Michiko , don 't torture me ! 
You fail because you think it 's a human head . 
You 're a hopeless one . 
It worries you ? 
We need a new leader for the prisoners . 
I 'd cry bitterly . 
Being called up isn 't a death sentence . 
Is anything wrong ? 
Let this damn war go to the dogs . 
Think I 'm blind ? 
We 're discussing labor problems . 
Sick , huh ? 
When we run out of tobacco , we suffer again . 
Here they have no mother , no wife , no children . 
You fool ! 
Does this man 's death mean others may also die ? 
We all suffer the same misfortune . 
Is something wrong ? 
Let 's stop worrying about it ... just for now . 
You 're wrong . 
He need only find the cause of his unhappiness . 
The Japanese will exploit them and then kill them . 
Nothing can come of it while there 's a war going on . 
Is the war going to end ? 
If you want to die , just try to escape . 
Want me to scare them a little ? 
I shall do my utmost to correct this mistake . 
No one wants to risk the danger of escaping . 
Is Jin Tung Fu in ? 
There 's a problem . 
Don 't worry , young one . 
Don 't worry . 
Hey , lady- killer ! 
Go tell him it 's too dangerous . 
If you betrayed us , it 's a bullet in your head . 
- Lies ! 
Go to sleep and stop worrying . 
Kill me if you dare ! 
You 're a hopeless case . 
Poor man . 
You see , they tried to kill me . 
It 's so horribly sad . 
Something wrong with your eyes ? 
Don 't worry . 
He 's wanted for murder . 
You didn 't get hurt . 
I may go back to hating you . 
You seem to be trying to fill mine with rotten apples .

I 've never met anybody like you , Miss Fabray . 
You parry as though you were scaring crows , Mr. Fisk . 
I 've no doubt . 
It lost him the battle . 
You have trouble following orders ... 
It 's nearly killed me being away from you . 
You ought to be ashamed of him . 
Nonetheless , sir , it was an insult to the entire South . 
Don 't worry . 
Priam needed to be punished ! 
I always knew you were a coward . 
Sorry I didn 't give you more warning about my visit . 
Why , they come from slavery itself . 
That 's insane . 
That 's an embarrassment to me , Mother . 
I find their way of life repellent and wrong . 
You are disgusting ! 
And knowing her , that 's what worries me . 
Supposing he blames me for leaving you ? 
You see him as a nigger ! 
And her brother assaulted me . 
I 'm afraid I 'm wasting my time . 
Think how disappointed the rest of them would be . 
I haven 't had any complaints so far . 
Why are you so sad today ? 
It ain 't right , your beating on Miss Madeline . 
Many of us in the military abhor Davis ' cowardly policies . 
She died quite a while ago . 
It is indeed a tragic story , madam . 
He and his five sons butchered slavery settlers in Kansas . 
And evil sees evil in everything . 
We 've got orders to shoot anyone who gives us trouble . 
- It 's too dangerous . 
You think he 's dead , don 't you ? 
We 've had so many disappointments . 
I 'd rather be a fool than what you are ! 
I didn 't think it would be this bad . 
Now you 've put me to shame , George . 
Too bad George couldn 't be here to see you . 
Mr. LaMotte 's been hurt . 
- Forbes , you 're a fool . 
He 's dead , Ashton ! 
It was all your fault ! 
I 'm so ill . 
The man is incompetent . 
You 're such a devil . 
The militia killed Grady . 
But what you did tonight was very wrong . 
You 'll probably keel over in a dead faint at the altar . 
It 's just terrible . 
- But he just rubbed me the wrong way . 
A man can get drunk and get into fights ... but a woman can cry . 
You stop to be able to fight its war … … and I … 
That man is a prisoner . 
This war must be quite annoying for you , truth , Mr. Holden ? 
It watches the failure . 
She was downcast and without appetite . 
Also it was silent ill our phamacist . 
Aerial attack ! 
Hatred that becomes scrap iron .

Are we gonna kill you ? 
I 'm ground sick . 
Sometimes a person could ruin your life . 
It 's just a problem with the races , that 's all . 
What 's wrong with him ?

Goddamn , this place is scary , yo . 
Get off of me , you pervert . 
How stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you . 
It 's your sick little scene now . 
Well , no wonder they 're still pissed off . 
We 're all going to die . 
Scared the shit out of even me . 
- Damn . 
What is your problem ? 
She 's dead . 
It wasn 't goddamn ghosts ! 
Damn it . 
Tortured . 
They know you 're already dead , Evelyn ! 
The ghosts you is already moving and that is bad sign . 
Violent and different . 
My husband loses the reason for the jealousies . 
Did he/ she know that she is blind ? 
I believe that it is only a little dismayed , not hysterical . 
And we all have weapons . 
Weapons ? 
It tried of killing you and it killed their wife . 
Reason to lose the time ? 
Let me cleanse my mouth of the stench of the Egyptians . 
For too long we have delayed plans for his destruction . 
- And how will you destroy Solomon ? 
Grave criticism is being brought against him by people . 
Is your hatred for the Egyptians greater than your hatred for me ? 
The Lord has punished Solomon for his sins . 
Woe unto us .

- He must be broke again . 
- You had me worried to death . 
If you 're not giving me the money , forget it . 
Now what are you crying about ? 
Oh , what are you talking so crazy ? 
He worries about me . 
- All of a sudden I cry . 
- Who 's crying ? 
You know how sick you get . 
Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny 
You 're so crazy , you 're dri ... 
- He must be broke again .

But I think it also means that I 'm gonna die a lot sooner . 
What 's wrong ? 
No more mirrors , no more prying eyes . 
Don 't worry , he 'll get his someday . 
It 's so ugly . 
Damn ! 
No shit ? 
Got her pregnant , caused her death . 
You bastard ! 
You 're getting worse . 
Shit ! 
I won 't hesitate to kill you in a second , if I have to . 
Do you remember what you told me after my father 's death ? 
He almost found it , but for one instant ... he was careless . 
Once Philippe got very angry at me and threw sand in my face ! 
Why do those nasty little brutes bother you ? 
Rat bites are dangerous . 
If it 's disturbed , Philippe will be lost for ever . 
So hopeless .

Don 't upset your mother ! 
- Don 't worry , it 'll work . 
Women are exploited and can 't defend themselves 
- He 's a liar ! 
Was she ill ? 
Parents spoil 'em rotten ! 
I know school teaches lots of useless stuff 
So I tell lies 
In spite of things we 're a solid couple 
- Jonathan , no , it 's too dangerous . 
Diana has brought you here to murder you . 
We don 't have time for anything but war . 
Please , don 't make me kill you . 
What 's your problem ? 
Sorry if we disturbed your experiments on human guinea pigs . 
Don 't mock me , Lydia . 
Mock you ? 
- With orders , shoot to kill . 
Don 't upset your mother !

The Dangerous Liaisons - 1960 
Mrs. Volange broke the news to me . 
You don 't know what evil is . 
You 're awful . 
Poor guy . 
No liaison is ever too dangerous for me . 
Tell me ... was it really so unpleasant ? 
Go ahead and cry . 
- I have my own problems . 
I don 't want to hurt her . 
Can 't you even Iaugh properly , you idiot ? 
- He 's a poor painter , 
My ghost wiII haunt you and take the rent ! 
Anybody else , and I 'd have broken his teeth . 
- The idiot ! 
Have you gone mad ? 
No use getting scared now . 
Don 't be scared . 
No , don 't bother . 
I 'm one of those unfortunate ones . 
You 're misunderstanding me ... 
That box2of poison has gone with the medicines ! 
I 'm a very poor man . 
I was reading a strange , horrible story . 
If you defy me , I 'II ruin that man ! 
Much terrible than this ... 
Money doesn 't make one coward ... 
And that he 'd ruin your uncle ? 
- Lies ! 
The Prosecution says I should be hung . 
And that very poison kiIled her . 
Don 't cry , 
Countless people have died 
And kill Tiemuzhen 
Nonsense Talihutai , you 're perfidious 
But mother is more starving , you know ? 
How can you kill each other now ? 
I was wrong , mum 
Brother you killed Talihutai 
I felt depressed , hesitated and at loss 
It cost a whole year to prepare for the war 
I heard Tiemuzhen is attacking the Mie 'esqians 
He will risk his life to defeat heary odds 
Frightened , the two beasts became interdependent 
The whole 3 days of fierce killing 
Your enemy has also been wiped out 
The prisoners are all yours now 
But I can hardly defeat my ego 
Now the Mie 'erqians have been defeated 
I feel ashamed of my narrow- mindedness before 
On no condition must this leak out . 
My crime deserves 10, 000 deaths . 
You are very rude . 
Not bad ! 
It is all your son 's fault 
That she 's sick and pining away . 
I don 't regret anything 
A glimpse of a frightened swan 
All of you withdraw and prepare to counter- attack 
Don 't worry your majesty 
I will start the attack immediately 
Can you confirmed she was shot by the poisoned needle ? 
What I cook is not delicous is what you cook is really awful 
In this big family , eversince we are young we live in war 
Can you concoct the poison ? 
He can escape from death 
All our brothers are dead 
Even if I have to die 
You 're all terrible . 
No princess is to scare me ! 
The pebbles they threw hurt my knee , it hurts . 
Bullshit ! 
Damn . 
Damn it ... 
I don 't think it is a problem at all ... 
Are you beaten be cane , Mr. Leung ? 
To let him die ? 
I am going to die . 
Why did Tong have to kill that man ? 
- You were merely blind guessing . 
It is not merely a laugh . 
You are stupid . 
The police force is the one to be blamed . 
Kwong , I am going to kill you ! 
Don 't worry . 
I know I am getting trouble . 
' O , the fury of a woman maddened ... 
Iwa , aren 't you getting tired ?

Not too bad , huh ? 
- Drop your gun . 
They pay you half hoping to see you killed .

He 's a skeptic who makes a mockery of religion . 
- A lying , drunken jury- swayer . 
No , no . 
It wasn 't for spite or hate ... or for money . 
Isn 't a lifetime behind prison bars enough for this mad act ? 
So we sweat through three months of misery just to hear that .

Philippe , you 're causing a scene , and I hate that . 
I am most terribly embarrassed . 
But not as pleasant as you think . 
From a moral point of view it offends me ! 
Don 't be mad at me . 
I have some very sad news to break to you . 
Aren 't I living proof that studying is a waste of time ? 
You are lying ! 
I will specialize in mental illnesses . 
Strange warning .

It is forbidden to chain the political prisoners . 
Unchain the political prisoners . 
- If they see you , detain him and inform us . 
You should have caught him and prevented the policeman 's death . 
You will see men hurt , and you will feel impotent . 
You tried to flee , and my men killed you . 
He is a despicable coward ! 
I am going to tell you something seriously wrong .

Stop crying , Sheil- o . 
I 'm so miserable . 
You mean I 'm fired ? 
The problem , of course , is your delivery . 
Did you fellas tell me that you have a housing problem ? 
Scott , I hate you ! 
Awful . 
You always pretend ignorance . 
I feel weak . 
I lose control when I drink . 
The master will be too helpless without you . 
If the family is seriously worried ... 
It 's a terrible thing to lose one 's husband . 
I think she committed suicide , followed by the young couple . 
Any more arguments ? 
Followed by dawn attack training . 
Does that account for the broken China ? 
Absolutely no sex appeal ! 
Go kill yourself ! 
Private feuds could mean prison term . 
lies with the military . 
Don 't worry about that . 
A crying pheasant dies . 
Vets are not joyful . 
The enemy ? 
Fool ! 
Let me punished alone . 
We could beat the hell out of those vets . 
Don 't be stubborn ! 
Take your troubles to Lt. Kageyama . 
Might get jealous . 
Idiot ! 
Tashiro , to the supply depot for weapons ! 
I don 't suppose your recruits want to die either . 
Enemy troops to our rear ! 
We attack , if we must . 
One might hate it , but there 's no avoiding it . 
Sir , have I done something wrong ? 
Son of a bitch ! 
Coward ! 
Absolutely no sex appeal ! 
So you 're implying that I indirectly caused my husband 's death ? 
It 's damn hot . 
Obara 's death is shame enough for this company . 
The enemy ? 
Let me alone be punished . 
I 've been in and out of worse places . 
Antitank suicide squad , PFC Akaboshi . 
Hold your fire ! 
We 're trapped ! 
- No , it 's bad for you . 
The woman on block 10 . 
- No , don 't worry . 
Don 't cry . 
I told the women in my hut to sabotage the work . 
No work , no screenings . 
Scumbag !

If he moves , shoot !

Poor Faust ! 
Idiot . 
You shouldn 't waste any more of his time . 
We should 've killed him at Akiba Shrine . 
It 's gonna be an all out war . 
Now , bring this letter of declaration of war to Jirocho himself . 
At beat , they 'll owe they hate my guts . 
- Weary , you 've got a broken record . 
He say something wrong ? 
- If we 're attacked ... 
I was only writing my girl how lousy I feel . 
If they still refuse , then you must die ! 
If they do not admit me , I will kill myself . 
Don 't worry . 
They 'd kill us . 
It 's hopeless . 
Hurry up and get to Palompon , you idiot ! 
Yasuda 's leg starts hurting at night .

Are you frightened ? 
Anyway your water was awful , I thought my head would explode . 
Holy shit ! 
It 's a pity to look how they kill those trucks . 
Your own piece of land after your death . 
Man , are you a devil ? 
No , it 's not worthwhile . 
Stop telling this nonsense , shall I load more or not ? 
You 're very drunk , aren 't you ? ... or am I wrong ? 
Don 't cry , sing . 
Don 't be a fool . 
Not bad . 
The saucer 's dead . 
- Oh , I wouldn 't worry . 
The saucer 's dead . 
Because the bloody boiler room is flooding , that 's why . 
Don 't you see , the underwriters will assume you 're lying ! 
You talk about him as if he were a criminal . 
No point in wasting this stuff . 
- That the wreck was aground ? 
Valeria , I 'm in trouble 
- Stolen ? 
Don 't cry , madam . 
Any problem ? 
It isn 't anything bad 
- Did it hurt ?

- Don 't be so cruel . 
You said he was arrested with some communists . 
You 'lI need to ask the prison . 
She 's always moody and argumentative . 
I thought I could trust you , but I was wrong ! 
Spread the word that we 've arrested DeIla Rovere . 
The problem 's sorted , he 's staying . 
I 'lI give his poor parents the news . 
Faced with a mother 's anguish , what else could I do ? 
Keep him under surveiIlance and in isolation . 
- Are you hurt ? 
At worst , he 'lI be sent to a work camp . 
Don 't worry , 
Don 't you think it wiII have a negative effect on his spirits ? 
It 's a disgrace . 
It hurts so much , how unlucky could I possibly be ! ? 
I have been abandoned in a strange land . 
I 'm lying in a different position . 
- " Mein Gott " , such pain ! 
They 're mad ... always want to talk ... 
Damn , look what they did to you ! 
We 'll have no trouble here ! 
To forget all his woes ... # 
Don 't worry , I know you 're defending me ...

And that hurts . 
The lid 's coming off on Lou Carson 's death . 
You arrested Joe Genest for assault and battery six months ago . 
Hell , nothing ever happens here . 
Jesse , I got a problem . 
No , no . 
He 's singing the wrong song . 
- No , no . 
# I never was a hero in the forces 
# And end up dead at least it 's not my fault 
Don 't worry , Chatters , I will . 
No , no . 
He 's singing the wrong song . 
- No , no .

A woman is in danger of dying . 
That poor woman died some minutes after , and - 
Don 't worry . 
Don 't worry . 
Forgotten , ignored by everybody . 
I 'll kill you , because nobody will be better than me . 
I don 't see what all this has to do with a simple car accident .

No , it represents death . 
That would be a horrible death . 
The death certificate ? 
Mom gets upset ! 
Nobody will die if she keeps her crib . 
A murderer who confesses Before dying 
Recognizes that killed his wife . 
The blood shed , This is the most serious sin 
When you know his first disappointment . 
He called it the evil in our century .

So you 're asking for trouble . 
After the first failure . 
A whore ! 
I 'm sorry I disturbed you . 
You 'll get killed ! 
What 's wrong ? 
A false pre- war neutrality in a false medieval setting . 
Maddalena ... what 's wrong ? 
- Was I wrong to call you ? 
While I suffer and I can 't forget 
I 'd do it even if I knew I 'd die in six months . 
You 're getting your hair dirty with sand ... 
I hate the smell . 
You think she 's poisoning him ? 
Why would I want to hurt my husband ? 
You gonna make me hurt you ? 
Because you were trying to kill him . 
# There 's nothin ' wrong # 
Admittedly , not as interesting as staring uselessly at Foreman . 
- He 's angry . 
- Cut the crap . 
I 'm trapped inside a monitor ! 
Then you shouldn 't have fired Chase . 
Real guests , not them paying kind . 
Because we 're broke doesn 't mean we have to lose our dignity . 
That poor cupid , he looks lost without them . 
- But suppose he denies it . 
Don 't worry . 
I haven 't done anything wrong . 
John , Mrs. Jorgenson said you threatened her just now . 
- It 's a scientific fact that bad ... 
Haven 't we all had enough of hating lately ? 
- If this story continues , I 'll kill myself . 
- No - It 's no trouble , a vermouth ? 
- To the poor lady , I meant . 
- Don 't worry , I know the way . 
Why aren 't you crying over me ? 
You 're nagging because he 's not here ! 
- Liar ! 
- It 's broken . 
Not bad . 
I was terrified . 
No doubt . 
- If this story continues , I 'll kill myself .

Oh , no no .. 
Was I terrible ? 
Alice , I hate to see you hurt . 
What 's wrong with wanting both ? 
No I wouldn 't hurt her . 
Oh , I understand now what makes men kill women like you . 
Hmm , even then you didn 't starve . 
Oh , it reminds me ( SPEAKlNG DRUNK ) 
Don 't worry about the way the world runs , lad . 
Seriously Joe , there 's something wrong , isn 't there ? 
That 's not a very kind thing to say ... 
I suppose I 'm scared . 
Really and truely " till death do us part " . 
And you didn 't see how you were damaging yourself as a person . 
I don 't give a damn for Jack Wales . 
You low rotten ( ... ) You murdering little fancy man ! 
You 'd drop dead before you let someone else drive . 
Let me bloody go ! 
You got a beating . 
Dickhead ! 
It 's time you learnt the rules about life in prison , Marcel . 
They expect the prisoners to pay them for everything . 
Counsel for the prosecution , you may speak . 
We can hardly write about every Belgian who 's in prison abroad . 
- Very weak , the poor man . 
He doesn 't know what he 's doing in his grief . 
I have been fired . 
If there 's any nightlife in this dump , I haven 't found it yet . 
I 'd better go home , and try and kill my wretched cold . 
Hey , is something wrong with you ? 
He 's going to get cooked to the gills and kill you . 
Leave the polluted city and go back to the country . 
What 's wrong ? 
I was wrong about you . 
You fell for it , you sucker ! 
He died of the plague , too . 
They said the war was going to end in two weeks ' time . 
- You have a dead soldier . 
He is going to kill himself . 
Look , there 's a war ... and I got married in a veil . 
My son has also gone to war . 
Poor Ben , 
And you don 't have to worry about the cost . 
Believe me , you can 't go wrong with Plymouth Rock . 
- No accident . 
- but I 'm not your type , honest Injun . 
- It is sad that you let her marry another . 
Oh , you fool me . 
- A conspiracy ? 
Do not be so unhappy . 
My father is the enemy of Nevers . 
If we find them , we 'll kill them on the spot . 
Know that I am innocent of the crime of which I am accused . 
It was only a few days ago that you were sad , and wept . 
Who are you , to have abandoned everything for me ? 
I pray you will arrive in time to prevent the worst . 
- I fear so , Madame . 
- With a nasty look . 
- Anguish has disturbed her mind . 
Softly , it is painful today . 
He is dead , my Lord . 
Lagardère is dead , killed by dear Monsieur de Pérol . 
And you , my Lord , are not an easy man to move !

Your deception is revealed .

- Major , I 'm so sick . 
I gotta kill you . 
One act of cowardice doesn 't make a man a coward forever . 
We 're all gonna die in this God- forgot country . 
And I hope they kill you and put you out of your misery . 
Treacherous , vicious ... ... dishonest . 
That 's not a very friendly thing to say , Ernine . 
Can 't you see how wrong it was ? 
He intends to kill me . 
Your husband 's a stubborn man . 
Don 't worry about the boy . 
Don 't hurt her . 
Captain Bruhn , Captain Bruhn , what 's wrong ? 
I 'll show you what a Cheyenne does with a liar ! 
- Drop the gun . 
Hurts him to stand . 
Don 't you ever get tired of holding that gun on me ? 
I hate to see you lose your place up Socorro way . 
I don 't know why anyone would wanna kill Georgie . 
Yes , but what about cancer ! 
- You 'll hurt yourself ! 
What 's wrong with you ? 
I also went to the spinster 's place , but she 's very tired . 
Yet , I can 't figure it out and that 's what 's troubling me . 
- This is for your trouble . 
Bat , what the devil are you doing here ? 
See , I 've been running it ever since my husband died . 
Hey , Doc , what happens if somebody gets sick ? 
I don 't know what would be wrong with that , Sheriff . 
I seem to make trouble . 
Why should I feel guilty ? 
This is a waste of time . 
I 'd be the lesser of two evils , is that it ? 
I 'd hate to see father and all those other people disappointed . 
Get back inside , I don 't want you hurt . 
Why , don 't be scared , Lily , don 't be afraid . 
- You 're prejudiced . 
Worse . 
Not a dirty sailor ! 
- Bitch ! 
I 'm sick of your tricks . 
Next time you misbehave during a service will be the last ! 
Don 't kill me ! 
What 's wrong with the sea ? 
It 's hell . 
I regret it terribly , of course . 
It was illegal as well as foolish . 
So you deliberately lied to me , then ? 
- Hurt yourself ? 
- No bones broken ? 
Very , very , very bad . 
Or to mourn , if we don 't find them . 
- I don 't give a damn about your morals that come from books . 
You 're tired . 
- Damn . 
We 'll make war on you yet , Mother Nature . 
No to despair .

Doctor , I think he was going to steal the gun . 
No ... no ! 
I was being bad . 
Are you in pain ? 
Fire ! 
Katsumiya , we must solve our ray gun problem . 
The traitors will be punished . 
Damn , it 's Radio Paris . 
Most are much worse off , even in France . 
Damn , I have a rotting tooth . 
I 'm trying to sublimate the base lust of this idiot . 
That 's nasty , Pommier . 
- No , that 's a bad sign . 
Bad . 
He follows the news about the war . 
Sad . 
A prisoner of war doesn 't reassure the people who ... 
Damn . 
- Openly as a prisoner of war ? 
Without ever arguing . 
Let 's play cards to kill some time . 
That 's the weakness in your plan .

Damn ! 
Seems I 've failed . 
- It 's possible she 's wrong , sir . 
- You trying to kill us all ? 
- Is something wrong ? 
Lady Windham , how could I have been so thoughtless ? 
What happens if you are attacked ? 
Not a life destroyer . 
No , no . 
You mustn 't be angry with her , she 's one of the old school . 
Gupta , your English is hopeless . 
- He would have killed you , memsahib . 
You can 't depress that gun any more . 
You 're quite wrong . 
( Baby cries ) 
Shame ! 
Kanta absolutely despises the role of Paro . 
I ask , why do you consider it to be so bad ? 
But you have seen that your companions have failed me . 
How can I shoot with that wild creeper on your head ? ! 
" all of them condemned zero " 
And now , you say that I am incapable of directing films ! 
A three- legged horse is useless . 
- No problem . 
This will completely ruin you !

And now , you say that I am incapable of directing films ! 
A three- legged horse is useless . 
- No problem . 
This will completely ruin you ! 
Don 't worry . 
DRUNK MlNER : 
The only warning Bishop knows is killing . 
You 're worse than a hydrophobic skunk . 
I told him that thirst was gonna kill him , and it surely did . 
Two men dead , friendships broken , a man parted from his son . 
Five dead bodies , Mr. Pryor . 
Until the Morgans are trapped by that rope . 
You killed all my brothers ! 
How could I ever hate you ? 
I 'd hate to see your sister hurt , too . 
Are you very disappointed ? 
She never loved me , and I knew that . 
Maybe you know who did kill her ? 
' Cause she 's got the same kind of crazy idea . 
I don 't look bad , do I ? 
For a talky man , you 're awful quiet . 
Oh , don 't worry about it . 
Don 't worry about a thing . 
Tell me , Jesse , why 'd you kill Sue Ellen ? 
You could starve to death . 
( woman crying ) 
We was gonna start down on time , but ... ( baby crying ) 
Oh , don 't you worry , Adam . 
Don 't you worry none about old Hoss . 
Hey , don 't shoot ! 
Nobody will kill you but me if you betray me . 
My father will kill you . 
I guess that was just an accident , Mrs. Buford . 
He 's the worst poker player on the wholeComstock . 
Well , now , Mr. Kyle , it 's your war , not ours . 
You dirty it every time the words come out of your mouth . 
" Blind with thine hair the eyes of day ... " 
I could feel the pain in the air . 
Don 't worry , I 'll get there . 
So long as it don 't bother , bother you none . 
You can die now or later . 
I 'm gonna kill me some Hadfields . 
There 's always killing in that street . 
This ain 't no way to run a feud . 
Before we lose our patience and string you to the nearest tree . 
Put down the war club . 
You take terrible risk . 
It 's not everyone that could lure a young fool kid to his death . 
No tickee , no washee . 
It was an accident , Joe . 
Look , don 't worry , Lee Chang . 
As the Lord is my judge , that boy caused Sally to die . 
Jimmy , don 't you worry none . 
Your sister died , too , didn 't she ? 
Well , Fulmer ... three dead . 
I am tired of being cooped up in this hotel room . 
No , no , no , no . 
You want to avoid confusion , hmm ? 
Was she upset enough to call off her hired killers ? 
No , what can poor Morales do ? 
I don 't want to be hated . 
And I ask , you ever see such a pair of working fools ? 
Now don 't you shed no tears over them Cartwrights . 
Hold your fire ! 
Now he 's taught you not to trust anybody , huh ? 
' Cause you killed 'em straight off . 
Pa , I 'm gonna kill him . 
Does it disturb you to see a murderer in chains ? 
No , Miss Strasser , that is not a request . 
Don 't lose no sleep over me . 
You just had to kill somebody , didn 't you ? 
I killed Cutler in cold blood . 
Oh , now , ain 't that too bad ? 
You 're lying , mister . 
Now I know you 're lying . 
It 's a shame they can 't be here tonight . 
You 'll have to kill me first . 
And running away will ruin your life . 
I brought you your prisoner . 
You came to Virginia City to close the LaRoche murder case . 
My fault ? 
I don 't want to kill you . 
Captain , I don 't see why that should be so odd . 
Corporal , take the prisoner in charge . 
Scare her ? 
His mother must have died . 
Oh , you 're wrong , Nedda . 
Mister , you turn us back there , and they 're gonna kill us ! 
No , honey , I can 't risk your life . 
He 's dead . 
Joe , you 're going to have to watch that temper , boy . 
Dead ? 
You 'll be dead . 
No violence . 
He could have been scared out of it or bought off or anything . 
Nothing to worry about . 
You 'd rather I waste it with my husband ? 
Belcher 's a typical bully boy . 
No , no , you haven 't . 
Don 't worry about them two , Pa , they 'll be here . 
No doubt about it . 
Don 't worry . 
You 'll just be getting a beating for nothing . 
But , dad- burnit , I 've been worried plumb sick . 
And Cut- Rate Joe 's gonna be stuck with him . 
Is something wrong ? 
Don 't you two know what 's wrong with Tod ? 
In spite of what 's happened , 
Virginia , if I 've done anything at all to hurt you ... 
It wasn 't your fault , Adam . 
That 's just the trouble . 
You can 't expect him to kill off healthy beef . 
They claim they 're gonna kill every head of cattle on our range . 
They must indeed be the weakest cattle of our herd . 
We aren 't starving , Mister . 
You 're risking an Indian war . 
After all , you fired me . 
Now , this is Devil 's Gate , isn 't it , Thorne ? 
You fancy- pants coward , you ! 
He found it just as he died . 
It 's a doggone shame , ain 't it , Charlie ? 
Hoss ... there 's a lot of hate piled up inside that boy . 
You 're a liar . 
Are you hurt ? 
Children can be very cruel sometimes . 
I shouldn 't have been sent to prison . 
I 'm terrible sorry . 
I hope he does kill Hoss ! 
There is no one in front of me , and no one in back . 
The danger is in the flesh , not fantasy . 
The devil is in me . 
Agony that will tear at your mind and sear your soul . 
The devil is in me . 
You killed him , Perkins , and you know it ! 
She was an eyewitness to the alleged crime . 
It 's the same sickness that afflicts this entire town -- fear . 
Killings and beatings and now a hanging . 
And once Sam Bryant knows that he 's facing a murder charge , 
From now on , all murderers will be hanged in Virginia City . 
Can 't you control that miserable coughing ? 
You look mighty unhappy , ma 'am . 
Hoss , don 't you realize , I 'm very sick ? 
Little Joe , you got it all wrong . 
We 'll kill you ! 
Ormsby 's no drunken fool . 
I want to stop you from making fools of yourselves . 
It is a mistake that will kill your people . 
Treacherous devils . 
It is an evil thing to see Ben Cartwright ride to war . 
Do you want to get us all killed ? 
Then you will stop them , or your son will die . 
These men see death and disaster in the mines every day . 
I sort of hate to mess up these new clothes I just bought . 
All very bad shape . 
Don 't you worry about it . 
He ain 't hurt bad . 
Try anything and people get hurt . 
Uh , a little uglier maybe , huh ? 
You miserable , stew- eating Swede you ! 
He wouldn 't want me grieving . 
I mean Himself , but you see , he wouldn 't want me grieving . 
By and by , you no have to come to restaurant no more . 
Five percent of the gross . 
Aw , don 't you worry , Annie . 
( woman crying ) 
Someone who understood the engineering problem . 
He wastes an awful lot of time . 
Not only getting worse , he 's almost gone , as has his mind . 
Sounds like a purveyor of the old evil eye . 
That stuff will poison you . 
We f- failed this time , but don 't worry . 
- You married in the war ? 
She was very difficult . 
I had complaints . 
Worse than a policeman or a customs officer . 
That 's fu ... 
Now , don 't worry . 
As I see it , we 've got the wrong woman . 
Stop that maniac ! 
And keep out of trouble in future . 
- Oh , they killed your wife . 
Why would I murder my wife ? 
No , he 's had the most terrible shock . 
- What 's wrong ? 
He 's got trouble . 
Paid killer . 
He was wrong about Dude , all right . 
That ain 't bad at all . 
No offense again , Sheriff . 
- He wasn 't a cheat then . 
It was probably my fault he cheated . 
You 're wrong , Sheriff . 
Now I 'm tired and you 're mad and I 'm getting mad . 
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me . 
I might do that just for spite . 
Tired , aren 't you , John T. ? 
You 'd be a liar then . 
I 'd hate to have to live on the difference . 
Still talking about that little accident last night . 
I was getting awful tired of taking care of you . 
My legs aren 't so bad .

It isn 't " What have you done with the dead body ? " 
You 'll get out , if you 're fired from a cannon . 
How very depressing . 
It was an accident . 
Now we 've broken through the fall , we can carry on . 
A whoreson mad fellow 's . 
Why , no , Your Majesty ... and to show I bear no ill will ... 
A wondrous future lies before you .

Let us punish the guilty , 
No doubt about that . 
We could have destroyed it long ago , if that had been our aim . 
- Is that the one you told me was broken into ? 
Eros , do we have to kill them ? 
We did not come here as enemies . 
With the ship and the ray gun gone , they have no control .

Don 't worry , Karis . 
It isn 't like you to be so cruel , Sisyphus . 
Without death , Xena has no way to defeat her opponents . 
Nonsense . 
There 's no reason for both of us to risk our lives . 
That 's a dangerous thing you got there . 
- His hands could shake from hunger . 
- I think that 's the Q- bomb . 
The bomb ! 
How did the war with the U. S. go ? 
It is worse than sitting on a barrel of gunpowder . 
- He said he wants it dangerous . 
The Q- bomb ? 
This bomb is stolen property . 
I 'm disappointed . 
Do we wage war against the world because of it ? 
Very difficult . 
- I 'm still a prisoner . 
We suggest you take that naughty bomb away ... 
- He 's an idiot . 
Get the bomb home . 
America wants nothing more than peace . 
The bomb has had a shaking up .

Stop it , let me loose ! 
If I start screaming the entire roman police force will hear ! 
Husband kills wife . 
- And why scream ? 
- Here , I have stolen them for you . 
They look like dead people ! 
Come on , don 't be stupid ! 
No , uglier than famine ! 
And now , for a couple of dirty liras , I have renounce that ? 
Filth , you will regret this ! 
Stop it , let me loose !

When we 're both sad we listen to military music . 
- Women usually are not so easy . 
It 's of no use alone . 
Everybody seems dumb talking about it . 
You 're disgusting . 
But after that they are angry life is not like their dreams . 
- No hide and seek ! 
We thought you were dead . 
An advantage over whores . 
You can still fuck a poor from time to time . 
I was wrong . 
- Don 't worry . 
Who were you beating on those drums ? 
Now , that wasn 't so bad , was it ? 
What could be worse than this ? 
But it 's getting more and more difficult . 
Dreadful ! 
There 's reaIly no reason for you to be so angry . 
Too bad , Sir . 
Why , you 're jealous . 
You 're wrong to act Iike that . 
You say it 's a prison break ? 
Then Ray Bennet must die ! 
" Ray Bennet , a murderer ? " No ! 
Too bad , Harry . 
Your chauffeur took the wrong road ! 
I 've listened to you damn long . 
Is that a stupid question ? 
Bad Blake is back in big . 
There are too many damn songs . 
Damn . 
Hey , Bad , climbing . 
Could worse . 
Just selfish bastards ! 
Sometimes you feel worthless . 
They make their lives miserable , 
He knows our suffering , 
Hell awaits you , 
- You 'd have enough time to die . 
You 're afraid the war will end ? 
Does this car have any defects ? 
It 's an old wreck . 
There 're no grenades , no war . 
It would be a pity to lose him . 
Germans had lots of injured and dead . 
I 'll be a useless victim . 
- No , no ! 
If you lose your man , find ... ... another one . 
Here 's the " fury " . 
We 'll leave as soon as the enemy attacks . 
We should be killed when ... ... Villa entered . 
To my grave , when I die ! 
He didn 't want to kill . 
Why do you insult me ? 
I prefer her dead before ... ... seeing her with another man . 
I can 't regret now . 
Or shame on me . 
And I felt ashamed . 
What the hell ! 
The first caress ... ... since that awful battle . 
I 'm tired of your talking ... ... of that Zeta all the time ! 
Such nonsense . 
- Why , is it that bad ? 
- I 'll steal another one . 
- Well , when you die . 
- What do you mean , strangled ? 
Old fool ! 
Liars ! 
You shouldn 't worry about what people think . 
They 're even worse than my boss . 
I 'm in mourning . 
Is he the son who died ? 
Something so strange , so terrible . 
My poor lamb , my poor little girl . 
That 's why I 'm in isolation . 
After that , I was punished . 
That I was punished ? 
Why are they so frightened ? 
Poor Aunt Vi was hooked from the beginning . 
That 's where Sebastian died ? 
Don 't worry . 
With your being ill . 
- Can we stop these lies ? 
- You trying to ruin this hospital ? 
Here are my hands ... ... but there 's no resistance in them . 
How he must have loathed being touched by her . 
He was lying naked ... ... on the broken stones . 
I don 't know what you see in such terrible sights .

He 's got a broken collar bone and his back may be injured . 
You don 't have to worry . 
He 's suffering from shock .

The trick will beat the hell out of you ... superboy . 
And why would Shelley be mad ? 
She 's very jealous . 
She 's mad , and I don 't know why . 
If they get out , they could get hurt , or lost . 
What 's wrong ? 
You stupid bitches ! 
I wish you 'd stop hating me . 
Not since the accident . 
I was in a bad place . 
Why do you want to ruin this for me ? 
Do you have any idea how much trouble you 're in ? 
I 've been wrong about something . 
A father ... or a troubled son ? 
I ain 't arguing with that marksmanship . 
It caught fire 'cause nobody cleans out the lint trap . 
Oh , Lord , I do hate a modest man . 
Cancer 's what I heard . 
She 's got a night- shoot on a low- budget film .

Don 't you worry . 
If you 're depressed , see a doctor . 
I 've kept you from harm . 
By destroying my whole life 's work . 
No pain . 
But laura 's dead . 
I broke out - me and another guy - in a laundry truck . 
They 'll see what happens to drunks that kill kids . 
This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me . 
How is it haunted ? 
If he hits me , i 'll die .

Who 's the man who ends up stealing the company funds ? 
Where i 'm not a little man with no future and no past . 
Mr. Sykes has been arrested ... for gambling with company monies . 
You lose your way , barney ? 
Don 't worry about the wings . 
You know , i had a nephew in the navy in the second world war . 
No , no , no . 
My head 's killing me . 
It will be so lonely . 
It wasn 't my fault , mr . 
All right , shirley , apparently it wasn 't anybody 's fault . 
You may lose your wife , tennyson . 
Please don 't go to the trouble of denying it . 
You can 't make me die again !

Not bad . 
Even as a dead man ... have your name up there - 
To you , pool is not a nice , friendly game . 
No , no , general . 
Shall we mourn for them ? 
Let them starve for a year ! 
They shot and killed him day before yesterday . 
You don 't have to be frightened of him , bill . 
But it 's a terrible , hot day . 
You tried to kill everyone who was left . 
I wouldn 't do you any harm . 
This one is for civil war buffs and the students of the occult . 
You figure you 'll shape up by the end of the war ? 
Death . 
You can 't fool me . 
He didn 't say anything , but ... his being there upset her . 
I can 't fool around any longer . 
But i don 't want to die . 
Your chauffeur said it was a matter of life and death . 
I was a stupid child when i married you . 
I hate you ! 
It 's not something that you fool with . 
And i hurt you in every childish way i could . 
I 'm not the kind to bury a body unless i 'm positive he 's dead . 
Mental illness is no longer hopeless . 
Are you a criminal ? 
Oh , don 't worry . 
Every litter bit hurts , so think before you throw . 
I 've made a complete study of evil . 
Very frustrating for them . 
You know , they go out of their mind with fury . 
I ... i think you 've developed some kind of obsession here . 
I ... i 'm ill , i think . 
Not so much as a cry all that time . 
The bartender tells me that he lies in a bed too weak to move . 
Death was an accident . 
The subject - fear . 
Not bad . 
Poor , unhappy little dears . 
You mean she died . 
No , no , no , now . 
You 're terribly stinky . 
Oh , no ... no , no , merely stunned . 
And now we must do even worse , because , mr . 
We have no war here , no crime , no violence , no greed . 
No , no . 
You forced us to examine our law . 
Are you going to be sick ? 
I 'm sorry i 've caused you any trouble . 
No dough , no hall tomorrow night . 
That 's a bad kid , that one . 
Kill ernst ?

I hate to see you hurt , son . 
Anything for poor charley . 
I am not now , nor have i ever been a " gloom cookie . " 
Andy praskins , you ought to be ashamed of yourself ! 
What have you got to lose ? 
This is ridiculous ! 
There are two unfortunate aspects of this . 
Oh , the ... president was badly wounded . 
You 'll give yourself some kind of a trauma . 
Now you 're in trouble with the internal revenue . 
I have this terrible problem . 
So , uh , waste a little time , hmm ? 
Thousands of alumni , not as successful , not as fortunate . 
No , there is nothing new in our crisis . 
I don 't think i could bear it if these figures were destroyed . 
If i were an idiot . 
What , do you want to ruin the whole thing ? ! 
What was terrible ? 
Oh ... but he 's so upset now . 
You 're fired from your job ? 
Something 's wrong , julie . 
Let the young steal from the old . 
It would be a crime . 
It 's a race of men , struggling for survival . 
likely to collapse any moment . 
Look , i know you 've been unhappy . 
A crime perpetrated by stupid men in bow ties . 
Give me a stick , i 'll beat it to death . 
Man , you 've been dead a thousand years . 
But all that live must die . 
Nuttiest way of trying to commit suicide i ever heard of . 
I push the button , i stop the watch , and i stop the world . 
Joe , insult me . 
You ... you kill me , boy . 
Damn you , i want to be big ! 
When grady 's up , the worries are over , right ? 
Lubin 's fault she feels rejected . 
You 're filled with blind , unreasonable hate . 
It 's all pre- bomb , all of it . 
An idiot leading the idiots . 
There 's enough poison in those cans to kill us all in ten days . 
You 'll pay , you ugly harpy , you , you ... 
Silence or cries . 
I hope you 'll find no word such as hate . 
I hope you 'll find no word such as hate . 
When that clock died , i was born again . 
Tell me his name , and i 'll cable him you 're sick . 
Hildy , what 's upsetting your sister ?

You got it wrong , ollie . 
Even worse than i used to be . 
Is that bad ? 
Sometimes i want to cry or frown . 
Marilyn , you are a very sick girl . 
He 's dead . 
Hate , violence , mistrust . 
Something terrible will happen , many people will die .

Soldier , tell ... to open fire ! 
Who do you two think you 're fooling with ? 
I 'll kill you ! 
I 'll kill you ! 
Why must you always say miserable , cruel things to me ? ! 
Because you 're cruel and miserable people . 
At long last , he 's dead . 
No horror , no fear . 
I got too much hate in me to keep plugged up anymore . 
Now , don 't you worry . 
Even when he lies down , i can still aim for his head . 
I am afraid we are of two minds about that kind of death . 
I don 't know , i just have a weakness for screwballs . 
You killed a defenseless man . 
Gooberman , you 're a very embarrassing man to have around . 
There 's just no reason why he should ... no , no , no . 
No cars , no people . 
Oh ... far from this sad world , mary rachel . 
No , as scared as i am , i want to stay . 
Don 't worry , aunt t , everything will be all right .

Pathetic !

Die . 
It would look ill with the people if brutus were his enemy . 
Then i suppose i will drown . 
If he 's chosen the wrong side . 
Oh, that 's pure scandal . 
In the presence of our enemies . 
Fools . 
You have it wrong . 
We 'll make a regular terror of you . 
I 'm told Hindus live on after death . 
Unto death , sir . 
If he says you 're lying , then I believe him . 
You 'll die only after many hours of agony and horror . 
Not as I 'm prejudiced . 
These Roman bitches . 
No disrespect to your women , huh ? 
Pullo 's dead to me . 
Don 't worry about those scribbles . 
He has to die . 
People will suspect I ordered his death . 
He is guilty . 
I know he is brother to you , but there is no choice . 
I don 't see what 's wrong with it . 
Is there punishment enough for monsters such as this ? 
So why do you not trust me now ? 
What 's wrong with you ? 
Kill someone . 
Let his heart be filled with sacred rage . 
Poison him . 
Horrible , horrible .

No man should own anything but his own weapon . 
We 're trapped . 
If we split up before we 're ready for Orsino we 're doomed . 
But if you are dead it will be of little comfort to your son .

Don 't worry

I didn 't want to believe ; it was too frightful 
- You killed him ? 
Don 't worry . 
It is so unfair ! 
And he is not the kind to run after women . 
Echigoya went through so much pain ... 
What is the problem with that ?

I forbid you to say something bad about the boss . 
You make her suffer . 
This natural catastrophe hasn 't left me indifferent . 
You must be very tired .

Oh , no , no . 
Because it has the smell of insanity . 
- People I don 't understand worry me . 
Now , he 's frightened . 
Then we should have no trouble . 
There isn 't any reason to worry . 
I think it 's degrading and outrageous for this girl to be here . 
No , no , no . 
He 's dead !

Been called a thief .

That 's probably where he chose to die . 
Put it on fire ! 
Selfishness , instability , sullenness , ingratitude at home 
No , it was dreary 
Murdering a doll ! 
You 'll regret it ! 
So your lazy and licentious habits led you to crime 
Without me , you 'd die of hunger

Suicide is always a protest against someone or something 
We used to talk about suicide 
I 've suffered enough , I 'm exhausted 
All your suicide talk doesn 't fool me 
You didn 't jump out of the window ; gas was less dangerous 
Three or four failed suicides ; you seemed better at murder 
How dare you joke of suicide ? 
He risked nothing , they were too poor then 
Malicious gossip , a misunderstanding left to fester 
She 's your pet , but no thief or killer

Sam Pegler , I want you to stay out of this fight . 
No , no , no , they have it , uh ... 
Oh , if I ever see a guy that was scared , he was it .

Rude , ungrateful ... ... to refuse a man 's offer is insulting . 
And lose a seal ? 
So many useless skins . 
One would kill all the foxes in the north . 
But the white man does not laugh with the women of other men . 
Otherwise it will die and you with it . 
Do you think they will stampede ? 
You 're my prisoner . 
It hurts . 
You killed a man . 
Other man ... ... foolishly got himself dead . 
It 's gonna be one hell of a long day for me . 
I told you , she 's sick ! 
I cry a lot , for no reason . 
Did I do something wrong ? 
Why are they all so neglected and forgotten ? 
Don 't you worry . 
Hates you ? 
He 's been notorious since he was your age . 
I 'm not a perfect man , Theron . 
But I would not cry even if you killed me .

And I returned home , with an ill heart . " 
No need to be ashamed of . 
He is dead . 
The mayor has a guilty conscience , he doesn 't dare to come out . 
Your son is an idiot . 
She told me horrible things , I don 't wan 't to see her anymore . 
You are my husband , how am I not going to love you ?

Revolting and miserable fools .

Sorry to disturb you at this hour . 
It 's not perfect , however ... 
I want the crime scene to look the same as before . 
But , Fujichiya has been deceived by him . 
If I go with you now , I 'll be a criminal . 
I wouldn 't call it a failure . 
In life , we sometimes do things we regret . 
They want to die along with the gas man ? 
It 's awful ... 
- Is the house haunted ?

Shissimatucki , don 't you think of anything but crime ? 
- Ugh ! 
No no no no , for such things you have your ghosts . 
You have told us that the Prince has molested you here . 
And didn 't you fear to lose the castle ? 
- You , should I murder you ? 
You 're arrested then . 
And he 's dishonest , too ! 
Why are you frightened ? 
He 's in trouble . 
You ought to have more bloody sense . 
It ain 't the first time I 've been in a losing fight . 
You are a liar .

Where does all this fighting get you ?

It 's a death sentence . 
Parr 's saw the killer . 
I could kill him . 
A murder- instrument ? 
Three murders in 24 hours . 
Somehow hedoesn 't seem likea killer . 
There 's nothingto worry about , Inspector . 
Here comes trouble . 
Don 't go to all that trouble . 
No , it 's nothing like that . 
It 's too bad about you and Tulsa . 
Some go away ... ... others come to fish in troubled waters . 
Killing him doesn 't mean relieving the farmers . 
The magistrate 's office is guarded as if at war . 
It 'll be suicidal for them . 
It 's all my fault . 
Don 't cry . 
I guide a blind bone- setter who carries my vegetables . 
He 's sick today . 
The sake is awful , as always . 
No , the smaller the needle ... ... the greater the pain ! 
You bastard ! 
A bone- setter ruined your store . 
You 're useless ! 
- Don 't you worry . 
Are you mad ? 
Damn ! 
Stop bullshitting , blind man ! 
How was the war ? 
Who knows what lies ahead ?

The trouble with this company is it 's run by old men . 
We don 't want ours teak ruined . 
Maybe just a coward . 
May I assume you 're aware of trouble in your home ? 
Don 't worry . 
Then you 're in the wrong business . 
I always thought , He 's such a fool , such a waste . 
It 's rude . 
It 's a shame , though - no one will see it . 
I suppose you also failed to collect any witnesses ' names ? 
Because in the struggle I lost my pencil . 
Nonsense . 
Not to hurt me . 
No , no , no , no . 
Did I weaken ? 
Why get married and lose each other ? 
# The royal set sans regret did it 
I 'm asking you to marry me , and you call it insulting ? 
What are you mad at ? 
# And the wrong place 
# In the wrong style 
No , no , no , no . 
- Scared ? 
The minute I see that Francois I will kill him . 
Oh , they were absolutely disgusted . 
I just wanted to tell you I 'm sorry if you 've been unhappy . 
# And the wrong place 
You 're going to be arrested . 
But you said , " No , monsieur , I refuse . 
You miserable ... 
You could have been killed . 
Pure shame you beat me to her , Cody . 
I 'd come looking to find you even if I had to die in the doing . 
Not go around killing them . 
Drop the gun . 
- You 're a bastard . 
Anyway , why should you worry ? 
And the damn thing 's right there , in front of me all the time . 
I don 't give a damn about our car .

One of my heads is appalled at my behavior . 
But there 's been an awful lot of hot air , too . 
And you know you 're wrong about the international set . 
Is it very painful ? 
I was never so frightened in my life . 
It 's a no- no . 
Do you imagine I slept after this betrayal ? 
Reading about the mad Mackays in the columns . 
Far cry from the simple souls I once knew . 
So , what 's the problem ? 
You wanna prejudice my case ? 
I wasn 't being completely selfish . 
We 're probably the dreadful end of a dreadful day . 
I was beginning to feel guilty about leaving . 
Don 't worry . 
As a matter of fact , I wasn 't too bad . 
But you were one of the dumbest children I ever met . 
Coward .

He insulted us ? 
Such concentration is unwise but hardly insane .

Anything to lighten the burden , eh , Kitty ? 
He is dangerous .

Nonsense ! 
But I 'm fighting Ciapciak ! 
A complete flop ! 
You 're an idiot . 
Of avoiding disappointment . 
Basil , that was disgusting . 
That is why we feel lost and lonely . 
I have a very bad memory . 
Sorry , no ! 
I 'm tired . 
Poor Joe . 
But that 's my brother 's fault , not yours . 
- Tomorrow I get the hell out of here . 
Trouble . 
I don 't want any amateurs who might get hurt . 
In the midst of your suffering ... 
No , but every year , no matter what ... 
No worries , no cares , no ties , no strings . 
What 's wrong with that ? 
I 'll never sing another love song . 
Don 't worry . 
If there are no further arguments ...

No , but you 're lying . 
- You 're lying . 
No , but you 're lying . 
- You 're lying . 
You 're awful , Toshio !

Killing women isn 't smart . 
' The man I 'm with is a killer . ' 
Killing doesn 't bother me . 
I was a sucker ! 
She 'd written ... ... ' the man with me is a murderer . 
I 'm broke . 
My father killed three people .

I 'm so frightened . 
He was already thought to be dead . 
An air of mystery surrounds the tragedy 
Unless Im extremely mistaken thats a submarine 
These are the hazards of wreck hunting in British waters 
But he wont go further as the wreck is a war grave 
With the Queen Anne 's Revenge under his control , 
It doesn 't post- date our wreck . 
After the hell of life on board

And it 's 20 years ago since you found the wreck 
I 've found a pirate wreck 
Taking a bearing they head for where the wreck should be 
They are close to the last wreck site 
One wrong move could leave it trapped in the wreck

He was the worst saílor ín the navy . 
This lunatic scheme will destroy us all ! 
- No ribs broken .

If the missile isn 't fired in six minutes - 
Dad , what 's wrong with the telly ? 
Bloody hell . 
And are you going to kill more people ? 
I know this world is screwed up . 
She 's not too old , I trust ? 
Tell me your sins . 
Seems I 've captured a dangerous terrorist . 
Terrible what St. Mary 's did to Ireland , wasn 't it ? 
You could get these poisons from any house in London . 
He leaves them at the crime scenes . 
- You 've come to kill me . 
Is something wrong ? 
- Fraud ! 
Then you have no fear anymore . 
Do you realize what you broke ? 
Wealthy people are hated . 
This is war , Milly ! 
We 've ruined the agency ! 
He 's been fired by 3 companies . 
Oh , how awful ! 
And that 's a problem ? 
If he doesn 't , he 's taking the wrong chemicals . 
He 's a frustrated munitions maker . 
You 're so decent , it 's hard for you to think ill of anyone . 
I 'm afraid , afraid I 'll be a failure . 
And if he resists , gun him down ! 
That would be dishonest .

Suppose you 're wrong . 
You mean , there 's no brain in your head to stop it ?

She died . 
If you do not heal him , he 'll punish me . 
No more , no less .

There 's been too much scandal already . 
I 'm not convinced all four of them are guilty . 
That 's a lie , you lousy doctor !

We 're gonna get awful thirsty around here . 
You 're all fools . 
Hey , fool ! 
The losses are immense , aren 't they ?

Trapped ? 
Bloody little nuisance !

I’ il knock your head in , you jealous little cat ! 
- Go to hell ! 
- Let go , you 're hurting me ! 
Look at that . it’ s dead . 
Have you been unhappy with me ? 
My God , what a travesty of a mother you 've turned out to be ! 
But when you did it all went wrong again . 
Tie him to the lamppost and leave him there to die !

Beat me to death before him 
It tastes worse than poison 
No , you are all wrong 
No worries 
Hey , don 't speak nonsense

He is not faithful to love 
Hey , little brother , the war is not a game 
I am afraid she will be sick

Have you a recurrent illness , Mr. Heath ? 
But I was wrong . 
You think drink will kill it ? 
We 're doing shocking things to your liquor supply . 
He 'll kill me . 
I 've already thought of killing myself . 
There 's just too much to lose . 
- What 's wrong with him ? 
- The war ? 
- You 're a thief .

All right , so It 's my fault I said I 'm sorry . 
That can lead to a normal , unhealthy situation . 
How could I be that stupid ? 
For the hypocrite , a liar , a fraud . 
It 's wrong for woman to chase a man . 
- Why , they 'll die in there . 
Lousy , stinking cruds . 
It 'll take more than a little steam to kill you , Butcher . 
This ain 't a bad dump . 
Now , no one with the name of Napoleon should ever cry .

I am devastated , Your Majesty . 
Why torture yourself ?

Screaming ! 
She looks tired .

There 's no sense in getting her upset . 
I worry about you , Emily . 
Then you 'll both know how wrong you are . 
It was horrible . 
No , but it 's beastly inconvenient , all the same . 
If that 's what you came for , you came to the wrong place . 
Tell me what 's wrong . 
Your son , a murderer . 
Help me , this will kill me .

A bit painful ... that 's all . 
Danger is everywhere . 
There 's the fire line ! 
The big brass dragged us out to this Hell- hole ! 
Fake commies , eh ? 
As quiet as death ! 
At first , we feared and loathed them . 
We 're damned ! 
With men it 's kill or be killed . 
He claims one of you kicked a prisoner . 
Fascist samurai ?

It 's desperation . 
We mean you no harm .

You 'd let your men meet a dog 's death in dangerous territory . 
It 's as still as death . 
With just men , it 's kill or be killed . 
He claims one of you kicked a prisoner . 
- Fascist samurai ? 
I 'm a prisoner myself .

I didn 't put you on this case to lose it . 
- Because the others stabbed him . 
Did you kill Roberto Escalante ? 
Mr. Bell , my newspaper is very disappointed in your performance .

Pains of death . 
She 's dead ! 
Now , you let me worry about his behaviour . 
Yesterday was my fourth anniversary here , but I got no cake . 
I have to make out a report about this killing . 
So I put my head on the block and I dummy up about the birds . 
You sick , little baby canary Jack ? 
Not bad . 
Mr Stroud , I 'm terribly sorry for taking so much of your time . 
We 'll have people angry from coast to coast . 
When it 's cut , it 's cut . 
What prison does to 'em . 
Graft , corruption , stupidity , sadism . 
What 's wrong with dying ?

Cheating his death again , like a good boy . 
Even the light has left us , now that we 've killed him . 
They told me death is not .... 
We 're two men who might be dead . 
You can 't kill me ? 
So , why shouldn 't we hate your name ? 
I thought I could never love it better than I did . 
- When he says death , death it is . 
Traitors and fools ! 
You were willing to let him go to his death alone . 
He made his own death .

Take this scarf and strangle Ed Mavole , uh , to death . 
How much longer must we go on with this nonsense ? 
Whom do you think he should kill ? 
I 'm not loveable , but I loved her . 
- It might bring mischief if I leave it . 
- Sick ? 
And I strangled Ed Mavole ... and shot Bobby Lembeck .

- How bad ? 
Let me hear the worst . 
No fighting after sundown . 
Nothing worse than a man- eating lion . 
Drums bad . 
I don 't steal ! 
You 'll never make it to prison . 
You want to get us killed ? 
Must be terrible . 
Of being disappointed in it . 
I warn you , this is not easy to accept at first . 
A neglected wife . 
Oh , I 'm very disappointed . 
He was so jealous . 
Then one day you 'll stab me in the back ? 
Damn it ! 
My jaws are aching . 
Of course , they 'll be jealous 
Should naughty children have their legs broken ? 
- So if I sin , I die ? 
Damn warrior caste ! 
- It all went wrong - Why ? 
lsn 't that a sin ?

let me discover who wants to hurt my Goddaughter . 
Why would he kill me ? 
Don 't interfere ... or your Masters will punish you . 
There 's no harm in the truth . 
There have been no difficulties . 
Tell me if my time of revenge will be then . 
It drives me crazy ! 
Everybody must be armed and expecting the worst . 
You criminal . 
Can 't you see he is ill with shock ? 
Just attending to business , Mr. Rash . 
They 're off across the marshes on a fool 's errand . 
Your mulatto , he broke into my house . 
Mr. Rash . 
And that Clegg left this mulatto to starve on a coral reef . 
Your mother is in a very bad state . 
A curse was put on us ... many years ago . 
He can 't be a criminal . 
- Oh , that 's very sad . 
- But he 's got me so upset ! 
But they make inferior footwear . 
I 'm sorry , but there is no service at this late hour . 
There is no doubt it is the same criminal . 
How terrible , isn 't it ? 
No ! ... serious . 
She wanted me to go naked so I wouldn 't ruin my clothes . 
Let him come to piss , I 'll show him . 
- I 'm injured . 
I told you it 's disgusting . 
No ! ... serious . 
She wanted me to go naked so I wouldn 't ruin my clothes .

I told you it 's disgusting . 
He is dead . 
My fear is my concern . 
You 'll lose another 50 men tonight . 
But I fear to do it ... ... upon my soul I do . 
There 's been a lot of killing one way or another . 
It 's awfully dangerous .

I 'm talking nonsense . 
She 's ill . 
I was sad . 
While mother was lying in hospital . 
I 'm so tired . 
It 's the evidence of her father 's crime . 
You were very young and a train whistle frightened you . 
Heard me crying ... ... that night ... in the hotel . 
Do you remember , as a child , dreaming of your mother 's death ?

What 's wrong with that ?

Come baby , I will do you no harm . 
Drumming them out of anger ? 
Soon he lies in the way if we fight . 
I am sick of an old t vrou_ je to follow . 
Don 't lose it . 
Are you hurt ? 
He 'll kill me if he sees me . 
Is he the one who sucked the stinger out of your thigh ? 
I 'm sick and tired of these Visigoths . 
The nightstand seems very dirty to me . 
She 'll get mad . 
Are you hurt ? 
You 'll come down with a terrible fever ! 
I might have taken the wrong way . 
You 're bad at your literature . 
Not bad , in theory . 
Maybe the poor girl died of that . 
Are you scared ? 
Before killing someone ... they play russian roulette with him . 
Don 't bother asking , cousin ... you 'll have to fight for it . 
It 's probably just some worry .

Answer me , Werner : is there something wrong ? 
Your life 's been in danger since yesterday morning . 
Franz went to take a look and was very disturbed . 
It 's a bomb that might go off in your hands at any moment . 
Oh , no , no ! 
We were defeated and now we dominate . 
It would terrify you , wouldn 't it ? 
I 've dreaded it for a long time . 
He 's dead . 
Could you be jealous ? 
Like when one is dead . 
During the whole of lunch you were looking disagreeable . 
It 's my fault now ! 
Liar . 
You frightened me . 
- Die ? 
Would you die too ? 
You have killed him ? 
Why do you waste it on him ? 
All hands on deck to witness ship 's punishment . 
So sick . 
- Don 't be a fool . 
Oh , I 'm sick of the taste of blood , boy- o . 
They hate him , sir . 
Murderers , all of them . 
- You hate him ? 
I perceived no uneasiness in his demeanor . 
I 'm sorry that he 's dead . 
It 's twice as dangerous to hang the boy as to let him go . 
There , Seymour , you reveal the whole weakness of your argument . 
And for myself ... ... revulsion ... ... shame ... ... and rage . 
All hands will stand by to witness punishment .

This corn is killing me . 
Even stolen goods . 
School 's a pain . 
Shame on you . 
- Because I 'd cry if she died . 
You knew this would end badly for one of us . 
Don 't be ashamed . 
Now you 've got me drunk ! 
Irresponsible fool !

Don 't be ashamed . 
Now you 've got me drunk ! 
Irresponsible fool ! 
My eyes are so bad now , I really should have new glasses . 
What makes it worse is her father died of consumption . 
I just said I was all wrong . 
- That bastard of a doctor was . 
How ugly they are . 
- Stop suspecting me ! 
- That 's foolishness , you know it 's just a bad cold . 
He puts on an act for every damn fool that comes along . 
I know how rotten it must be for her . 
- To hell with Doc . 
It 'd be a waste of breath mentioning moderation to you . 
I 'm so sick and tired of pretending this is a home ! 
No , the cures are no damn good except for a while . 
- Aw hell , he 'll have to go to a sanitorium . 
- Who gives a damn about that part of it ? 
Same old waste that will land me in the poor house at my old age . 
It was a waste of money James . 
You worked hard before you took ill . 
That was a rotten crack , I was just kidding Papa . 
And I don 't have to feel guilty anymore . 
- It 's so dangerous . 
Their contempt and disgust aren 't pleasant company . 
That foghorn ... isn 't it awful ? 
I was scared out of my wits riding back from town . 
It 's the foghorn I hate . 
I was a little hurt when you wished you hadn 't come home . 
In spite of everything . 
I don 't want to be sad or to make you sad . 
He 's been jealous of everyone of my babies and you most of all . 
I forbid you to remind me of my father 's death do you hear ? 
My ... my hands ... pain me dreadfully . 
Whore- mongers and degenerates . 
I 'm taxed to death ... 
I 'm as drunk as a fiddler 's bitch . 
All right go ahead and kill yourself . 
Then she began to cry . 
But you 're right , the hell with repining . 
You dirty bastard ! 
I 'm always suspected of hoping for the worst . 
I got to take revenge on everyone else , especially you . 
Don 't die on me , you 're all I got left . 
He loves to exagerate the worst in himself when he 's drunk . 
- Too damn sick . 
- You damn fool , it 's no good . 
It 's the damn poison !

I know how miserably uncomfortable you must be . 
I 've always hated this place and everyone in it . 
Stop suspecting me ! 
You know it 's just a bad cold . 
No , no ! 
Puts on an act for every damn fool that comes along . 
I know how rotten it must be for her . 
It 'd be a waste of breath mentioning moderation to you . 
I 'm so sick and tired of pretending this is a home ! 
Not that I give a damn . 
They 're both rotten to the core . 
That 's a rotten thing to say , Papa . 
Who gives a damn about that part of it ? 
Same old waste that will land me in the poor house at my old age . 
It was a waste of money , James . 
He was jealous of the baby , he hated him .

I forbid you to remind me of my father 's death , do you hear ? 
My hands pain me dreadfully . 
Whore mongers and degenerates . 
A waste ! 
I 'm taxed to death ... 
And for a moment I lost myself , actually lost my life . 
I 'm as drunk as a fiddler 's bitch . 
All right go ahead and kill yourself . 
Then she began to cry . 
But you 're right , the hell with repining .

It 's a shame . 
How do you know I 'm not that kind ? 
- She 's been stealing again . 
- Don 't cry . 
I cannot stand that sort of cruelty . 
- I was sick ... ... scared sick , and I needed you . 
And I stopped crying for you . 
You don 't get saved because you 've been born in hell ! 
You 're such a fool , Hallie . 
The press has it wrong . 
Not to worry . 
Have you no shame ? 
Bugging someone is a crime . 
Don 't worry . 
How appalling ! 
In short , the Pioneer is a murder weapon on wheels . 
- You 'd be fired , too . 
Are you going to torture me now ? 
He laughed and said it was a shame to damage a new car . 
I was such a fool . 
Uncommunicative , arrogant . 
Before I get mad ! 
You see , murderers like me always read the papers . 
Don 't get scared ! 
- I think they 're just scared stiff . - of what ? 
- There you 're completely wrong . 
Arrest him , We 'll check his ID ! 
Back from the dead ! 
To my buddy Gédéon , fallen in the booby trap of Long Son . 
Let 's attack the fortification .

We 'll destroy the village . 
His arrogance . 
Out with you , before I get angry . 
I stabbed him over 100 times . 
That killed Joan of Arc . 
We would have heard about it . if he had an accident . 
Who died in battle . 
Leave them alone , they are completely drunk . 
Attack the entrance . 
It 's a pity that Marie missed your fireworks display . 
You were stabbed . 
He was murdered ? 
Is that the murder weapon ? 
Violent death . 
You were stabbed . 
He was murdered ?

Violent death . 
You 're such an arrogant shit sometimes , Owen ! 
That was the bit I always hated . 
Find the weakest point , bit of brute force ... 
Look at me , you idiot ! 
Did you attack us ? 
You sick fuckers . 
It will spare us both embarrassment . 
You did not lead us to defeat . 
It 's not so much that I hate Poles , sir . 
Not bad , not bad . 
Would you destroy that ? 
- You 're mad , boy . 
Burn the witch ! 
They 're hard- pressed to give battle to a handful of volunteers . 
Each was on death row . 
Breck , we have a problem . 
Child- killing , Koran- ranting , suicide- bombing Arab . 
Awaiting death sentence . 
It 's called Fuck Your Mama . 
Motherfucker ! 
Hell yeah . 
Don 't worry about him . 
Well , he 's probably killed more men than anyone on that island . 
And quite frankly , it 's disturbing . 
You ungrateful son of bitch . 
What , are you trying to save some goddamn whore ? 
How about takin ' this bomb off my leg ? 
Bullshit . 
The port lies below 
If you have any problems , let me know . 
You 'll starve or they 'll kill you . 
You 'll get us all in trouble . 
- What kind of a war is that ? 
This time he 's declared himself at war . 
That could be a fatal mistake . 
It 's the lives I regret , señor .

I 'll destroy you ! 
I 'd lose my job .

Not- a bad . 
Don 't worry , Giulio . 
Nine stone 12 ... dead .

Damaging a police constable 's hat - and it 's not mine either . 
You talk as if music is something to be ashamed of . 
The hell with it . 
That we 're both scared ? 
I hate endings .

Throw those savages outside ! 
Poor innkeeper ! 
They have beaten me , I am ruined ! 
I don 't understand why he 's so stubborn ! 
We will attack the soldiers of her bodyguard as a group . 
That someone had caused the fall which killed him .

I have no racial prejudice .

The crying one om the bathroom . 
Is she dead or isn 't she ? 
They 're in big trouble .

Doesn 't bother you that he 's dead, does it ? 
Even for you, it 's insane . 
Dr. Jenkins is aII wrong . 
The newspaper reports of the Arlington murder warned me . 
Don 't worry , Parker has orders to ... 
And if anyone transfers to London those rotten Ohicago methods , 
They 're terrible .

You are rotten to me , Billy .

Ooh , you 're rotten . 
That poor girl . 
Billy 's pissed again .

I 've given you problems more than once with my fits of jealousy . 
You 'll end up killing your father and me ... with grief ! 
That 's no problem . 
No , I 'd rather let it go to waste than to be caught short . 
I 'm never fantastic . 
- Don 't waste your breath . 
I lose everything , or misplace it , or forget it .

The Magnet of Doom 
In my opinion , the referee was unfair . 
And anyway let 's be serious , what do you fear ? 
Very bad , Mr. Ferchaux , very bad . 
What 's your problem now ? 
That 's why there is no disillusion . 
Without choosing it , I 've tested my loneliness . 
The one killed had written : 
On November 7 , Gen. Mola attacks . 
Not afraid of death but afraid to die , they are civilians . 
In 3 years , 1 million violent deaths .

It 's unsigned , it 's unauthorized and it 's stolen . 
We 're pleading insanity . 
Well , right now ... this war is all about a man named Winston . 
- And you were an eyewitness to this cold - blooded killing . 
- The hell with Thompson and the rest of them out there . 
Are you trying to destroy that man ?

You poor farmer ! 
I was almost trapped . 
By the way , Sir Kinoshita , it has become a dangerous world . 
Stupid ... 
Don 't worry ! 
You don 't want to die , do you ? 
Kichi , you fool ! 
Maybe , Sir Kinoshita thought Murakami has aII useless men . 
His body is probably broken into pieces . 
Trouble ? 
I had a bad experience though . 
So you have these awful . 
- It does nothing but love him . 
She does not like to kiss the neck ! 
Plan of attack ! 
What horrible end ! 
He did not love . 
If you continue , you will lose everything . 
Go ride with Simon and no one bothered ! 
When we bend , shame ! 
It worries me . 
Too bad ! 
What nonsense ! 
- Charles , you 're annoying ! 
Poor , Antoine ! 
Yes , but I failed five times . 
Damn it ! 
Then I 'll kill you before being caught . 
But should humans live with only hatred ? 
That is your defeat . 
Yes , but I failed five times . 
Damn it ! 
Then I 'll kill you before being caught .

Yes , but I failed five times .

That is your defeat . 
Not a hint that you were in trouble . 
Spotted the trouble just after I called you . 
I sure as hell had you pegged . 
The whole damn squadron made it . 
I think your father 's tired , Davey . 
Oh , no , no , no , you can 't leave me alone . 
I was convicted on a murder charge . 
Davey , if I ever commit a murder 
He 's dead ! 
I 'll bet that paper is just full of that accident . 
How you must hate me . 
You can ruin it for everybody . 
It 's a terrible thing . 
You 're the one who 's in trouble . 
But it was an accident . 
Your problem . 
Any more trouble , he goes down the hill . 
Buck , he might be hurt . 
So he 's retarded . 
Whoever it was tried to choke your wife . 
Don 't worry about it . 
Sober , drunk , witty , boring . 
Dick . 
Welles , stop torturing that woman and child . 
I 'll die here . 
His marriage is already broken up . 
The neighbors had heard our arguments . 
The law says guilty . 
I told you , something awful happened . 
Uh , but not tenderly . 
I have quite a bit of trouble with Jenny Ammory . 
J- just heartbreaking . 
And , Jenny , I 'm scared now . 
Now you 're really scared . 
They all hate me . 
Wouldn 't have to be ashamed of her . 
What 's wrong ? 
No , no , not in here . 
It would kill me dead . 
Joe , there 's something wrong . 
She 's having labor pains . 
You 'd be dead a hundred yards in . 
Kimble was the bad one . 
I wouldn 't lose my appetite , Mr. Morehead . 
Oh , no , poor guy . 
No , it 's , uh -- It 's no problem . 
Captain , there was a search for the missing weapon , right ? 
You don 't have to worry . 
That 's where he got hurt 
The whiskey can 't cure it , but , you know , it kills the pain . 
I wish this lousy leg of mine would stop hurting nights . 
If that ever got on you , it could have burned you bad . 
Why , is something wrong ? 
Was that wrong ? 
( sighs ) This whole killing thing is hard to buy . 
He might die . 
Any pain ? 
You 're hurting her . 
You 're a scared rabbit . 
Well , then he 's dead . 
Was that wrong ? 
Now , would he have run if he weren 't guilty ? 
Stupid old goat . 
No , no . 
Poor little Annie . 
That 's bad ? 
It isn 't that bad . 
Now they 're dead . 
You sleeping good , killer ? ! 
This man has been hurt . 
And you wanna hurt your father . 
I have a selfish reason for wanting to find the one- armed man . 
There 's just a chance that the man that killed my wife is here . 
It 's all my fault . 
That 's the whole trouble . 
Don 't worry . 
Lee 's no fool . 
A man who couldn 't kill a dog . 
She 's sick . 
Steal it ? 
I wouldn 't worry about Herbie . 
No , Mr. Walker , there 's no turning back for me . 
You are a scream . 
Doesn 't come on in a flash of light and crash of thunder . 
He 'd cheated and he 'd stolen , but ... 
It 'll help kill the sound of the crickets . 
He 's got himself a wreck and he needs our heavy tow truck . 
We 're not positive it is Kimble . 
And if it hadn 't , I guess we 're in some kind of trouble . 
So ridiculous . 
If they quarantine , I lose , you lose . 
W- w- what are you getting mad at this man for ? 
If I knew I killed somebody ? 
I hate you ! 
No , that might not be any good . 
Oh , he went to steal some food for you . 
It ain 't any trouble . 
Don 't worry . 
You don 't want any more trouble , do you , kid ? 
From a convicted killer . 
You 're gloating like an evil little boy . 
I don 't want him to hurt you . 
He 's just a little angrier at me than usual . 
Man , what 's wrong with you ? 
I hate these oversized post holes . 
They stink . 
But you can hurt yourself ... if you get locked inside . 
Hanes McClure is a criminal , wanted everywhere . 
He 's dead , ain 't he , Tad ? 
I was just waving that gun around out there to scare folks . 
You could give him a couple of extra bucks for the scare . 
Bad enough . 
You see , Leslie was in an automobile accident . 
Oh , it 's all right , I 'm tired too . 
Lars would have killed me , you don 't know what he 's like . 
A man came in and killed her . 
Shame on you . 
You said , " if Kimble is dead . " 
He was finally dead . 
Judge Wilkins suspended sentence on Clark . 
I want you to know , they 'll hear nothing but the best from me . 
I was a prisoner in the same cell with your brother . 
You 're saying Joe Bob murdered my brother ? 
Floyd , if I can 't watch over one little prisoner , 
Madge , does this nonsense -- ? 
What do you think a murder trial is ? 
A masochist . 
Just what are they guilty of ? 
Everybody knew you and him had some trouble . 
Our pa was killed for nothing ? 
Don 't you worry about nothing , Roy . 
Don 't you worry about being late , now . 
I hate you . 
And feed them and stay up all night and I just hate them . 
There 's going to be no more trouble . 
He got scared again . 
I wasn 't a liar . 
I read in the papers about Ed 's trouble . 
Didn 't we , you bad thing ? 
Come on , Charlie , how 's it gonna hurt you ? 
Ah , you got it all wrong , Gus . 
Wrecks , damaged cargo . 
He 's a murderer , isn 't he ? 
He still blames me for Jeannie 's death ? 
No , no , no . 
It 's a rotten way to live . 
Doesn 't look too bad . 
Can 't blame her for getting scared and taking off . 
Blind . 
Cogan just died . 
Uh , these men are escaped prisoners , you know . 
You 're not the only one of us who kills people with his hands . 
I mean , revenge , anger . 
Why would anyone think that the accident was on purpose ? 
No , nothing more important . 
Tell me , do I detect an ugly , skeptical note in your voice ? 
She could pick up a prison sentence . 
You don 't " betray " a convicted murderer . 
Oh , Richard , you 're punishing yourself . 
Did he ever kill a woman ? 
Not since she broke her first expensive toy . 
Show 'em what a killer you are . 
He was some sort of criminal , wasn 't he ? 
He didn 't have to dump you right into this mess . 
You don 't want to go thinkin ' bad about Lucey Russell . 
Don 't worry . 
Ain 't no punishment staying here with Mrs. Deebold . 
If you saw him and didn 't tell me , you 're in big trouble . 
Well , the man 's a killer . 
There 's no pain . 
I wouldn 't worry you . 
You knew I was hurt ? 
You 're wrong . 
If I never loved you before ... 
No . no . 
Ugh . 
Dick . 
They 'll kill you , do you understand ? 
No fuzz , no heat . 
Oh , that 's too bad . 
Dead soldier . 
Uh , you mentioned a problem . 
Come on , give me the gun ! 
Now , tell me , what 's wrong ? 
Your sister is a very sick girl . 
Murdered ? 
Too stupid to admit you 're guilty . 
Killed ? 
Your father sent to prison , living in foster homes and -- 
I got a mess of questions , no answers . 
You 're lying . 
Maybe every once in a while they deserves to get broken . 
How come , uh , he wants you so bad ? 
Lies , false information , conspiracy . 
You 're wrong , Charley . 
I helped a convicted murderer escape . 
I want him arrested . 
He tried to kill me . 
Kenny , if you go out there , those men will hurt me . 
If they capture you , you 'll die ? 
Smog is a Murderer , all that jazz . 
Hey , do you really think smog could kill a person ? 
Nonsense , Mac . 
Is something wrong ? 
I didn 't steal it . 
Don 't worry about a thing . 
He fired her ? 
And besides all that , he murdered your wife . 
That 's too bad . 
That 's not a very funny joke , Nick . 
No , he 's no longer taking bets . 
I have to believe a lying little -- 
Oh , that 's too bad . 
The arresting officer witnessed the beating . 
When my mother died , I became his whole world . 
Well , she is very badly hurt . 
Now , let 's get into that bedroom and no tricks . 
No , no prison . 
A man like Robbins -- He 's dead . 
You risked your life to help capture a killer , Mr. Egan . 
That 's why he broke out . 
Oh , the warden says your injury isn 't too serious . 
And if you 're protecting someone , you 're a fool . 
I didn 't mean to hurt anybody . 
You walk out in front of me as if you 're my prisoner . 
Don 't worry about that . 
He was fired for stealing . 
Isn 't this an awful place ? 
Dick ? 
Oh , Dick , I 'm sorry . 
Her father died a few days ago . 
Oh , that 's horrible . 
That you , Dick ? 
And you lose your life . 
Does Dick know Gerard 's in town ? 
Don 't you think you were a little rude to him ? 
Bad . 
That 's the awful part about it . 
I would just die if anything happened to you . 
He must be bored half to death . 
I guess there 's no point in bringing charges against them . 
Each phrase must be attacked . 
You might have hurt him . 
It ruined his career , so he turned to coaching . 
I suppose it 's been a terrible struggle for him . 
You used your bow like a weapon , Geoffrey , to attack . 
I understand you have some kind of problem , Mr. Gordon . 
I drink , but I never seem to be able to get drunk . 
Anything we had together was stolen from him . 
All you got out of it was loneliness and misery . 
And don 't worry about me . 
Glenn , she 's dead . 
I can catch him and I can kill him . 
You don 't now , but you will -- He 's got to die , 
He 's an armed killer , isn 't he ? 
The only thing I need worse is a suit of armor , size 38 short . 
And check on the kids and see what kind of trouble they 're in . 
Anyhow , he admitted to stealing the money himself . 
That man 's been hurt long enough . 
I 'm the one that arrested him . 
You want to hate , don 't you ? 
It can 't be that bad . 
I 'm afraid the last time was our fault . 
He 's a little gun- shy ? 
The disappointment . 
For murder ? 
Frank , don 't be a fool . 
I didn 't convict him of murder , a judge and jury did . 
No pain . 
It was quick and no pain . " 
He was convicted of murdering his wife . 
No , it 's not Frank Bliss . 
Honey , stop fighting me , will ya ? 
Maybe I was wrong to tell Dick about it . 
Been a long time , Dick . 
Why , he 's a lousy pitcher , that 's all . 
No , no , operator , 
And that fluke can ruin both of us . 
It 'll be bad enough at the parade tomorrow . 
I mean , it 's too bad that he didn 't come back 
Oh , no , no , no . 
George , I didn 't kill anyone . 
She 's sick now . 
If she doesn 't get it , she could be dead in a few hours . 
At least he can 't do any more harm . 
Look , Josephus probably isn 't a bad human being . 
It was awful warm at the funeral this morning . 
She 's sick now . 
If she doesn 't get it , she could be dead in a few hours . 
She 's out of danger . 
No , no problems . 
You 're very tense . 
I can not believe how easily that woman deceived you . 
I don 't want to get you in any more trouble . 
They killed Kisuke ? . 
You can easily lay a trap for him and kill him . 
If only I weren 't blind . 
Bastard ! 
You blind bastard ! 
They didn 't hurt you , did they ? . 
That bastard ! 
You 're very tense . 
I cannot believe hoW easily that Woman deceived you . 
I don 't Want to getyou in any more trouble . 
They killed Kisuke ? . 
If only I Weren 't blind . 
Bastard ! 
You blind bastard ! 
I guide a blind bone- setter who curries my vegetable . 
He 's sick today . 
Sake is awful , as always . 
No , the smaller the needle ... ... the greater the pain ! 
You bastard ! 
A bone- setter ruined your store . 
You 're useless ! 
- Don 't you worry . 
Are you mad ? 
Damn ! 
Stop bullshitting , blind man ! 
Otherwise you get depressed and act foolishly . 
No , Lydia , and I mean no . 
What a crying shame ! 
Tomorrow I kill myself . 
" Worries over . 
Don 't worry . 
Young people today are hopeless . 
You defend the shadows , since the sun hurts your eyes . 
We 're stubborn , you know . 
We told Coppi , the cyclist , his girl had killed herself . 
A shame . 
Poor Alain . 
You 're looking ugly today , Ma Ubu . 
But it always went to hell . 
Otherwise you get depressed and act foolishly . 
No , Lydia , and I mean no .

- They murdered him , didn 't they ? 
The next few may be even longer and more difficult . 
No , don 't hurt him . 
Why did you cry , Caesar ? 
- Don 't you hurt him . 
And cast its evil eye . " 
Prisoners are surrendering in droves . 
You are sentenced to death . 
He was 32 and failed . 
That he will destroy the republic ? 
' Tis just as sharp and quicker and frightened of heads . 
Now an angry glance at someone who 's displeased you . 
Then let Caesar destroy Rome . 
A dead king , a dead god . 
Octavian has forced Lepidus out of his command and into exile . 
Do I trouble you , Rufio ? 
Went suddenly sick with it . 
- Nonsense . 
The milk of a cow of a goat and of an ass . 
War ? 
It would not be wise ! 
Your master must not be love . 
- Never fear . 
Meaningless under Roman law ! 
Your concern and worry are written all over you . 
Singing sad songs for Antony . 
How wrong I was . 
Nothing changes except life into death .

Titino , don 't be rude . 
No , no , I 'll get drunk . 
Poor kid , he 's lost . 
My wallet is in mourning , too . 
That rude , stupid man ! 
Someone may steal it , boy . 
But don 't you think I 'm angry . 
Fear . 
A kid is a live and constant problem . 
Did you hear a scream ? 
Please stop crying , he hasn 't even arrived 
I 'm sorry , I can 't find your waste paper basket .. 
Well , perhaps they were trying to kill me .. 
Wasn 't it rather rude of .. 
Follow that car , and don 't lose it .. 
- A crime to you maybe .. 
You are familiar with Tu- Fu, aren 't you ? 
Oh don 't worry Mabel ... 
Don 't be scared .. 
No , I’ m not going to stay in this house alone .. 
I killed him .. 
Naturally , I wouldn 't think of mentioning the stolen rope 
A judicial error .. 
- A man here was almost killed .. 
To protect Sir Francis from that murderer .. 
The thieves themselves , are still missing ... 
He 's terribly on edge , and he 's lost all his self assurance .. 
No matter how he tries , he’ s just not making any progress .. 
You 're going around in circles , about these murders .. 
I 've been hired to replace a musician who 's sick ... 
We hereby open the case of Percy Lister, accused of murder .. 
No , no it 's not true ! 
The secret court recommends , the death penalty .. 
Somebody has managed to steal the key out of my pocket .. 
It would be disastrous , if they ever found out .. 
Has it stopped beating ? 
And I saw that girl , lying on the bed of flowers .. 
It would mean the end of physical suffering , for all mankind 
That 's the reason for my failure .. 
Unless we export our wines , we 'll go broke . 
- Yes , but he was mad . 
Not bad , eh ? 
- I 'm speaking to you tonight -- - It 's the wrong -- 
Not to worry , David , old boy . 
No , no , before that , I mean . 
I 'm afraid it 's rather more sinister than that . 
- Oh , what a shame . 
No , no , no , by the feet , and keep me swinging . 
If anything should go wrong . 
That 's one way to get rid of the horrid thing . 
That 's a good idea, but what if on that day the weather is bad ?

Try telling me I 'm dumb now . 
I cut myself on my neck when the train jerked about . 
Don 't go to any trouble . 
In San Benedetto Po ? 
You can 't imagine the horrible meat they serve . 
Don 't worry , it 's only me ... 
No , you got it wrong . 
He 's mad , he 's ugly and he wants to dance . 
Poor man , you 'll ruin him ! 
He 's mad , but you 're just rude ! 
Not bad . 
A bit horrible . 
Another defect of mine is admitting my defects . 
It 's similar to the one I broke .

- No , no , no . 
I hate to see you go , Miss Wilson . 
- Rob , I tell you what I was thinking ... 
I 'd be alone all day , and I hate that . 
- No , it 's miss . 
Ashamed ! 
Honey , you have the most infuriating damned sense of timing ! 
Has it gotten so bad I don 't know when I do or when I don 't ? 
Live dangerously , huh ? 
The poor thing must be half starved . 
Don 't worry about it . 
No , no . 
Is that the way you killed Captain Arbuckle ? 
No , no . 
And I hated him . 
No , no , you got your orders , follow them . 
Poor Mr. Angelo ! 
The group working with Trabucco was one of the most troublesome . 
- Does it hurt ? 
- Damn it ! 
I was tired . 
Die " Samson ... with all the Philistines . " 
Son .. .. of a whore ! 
A simple joke punished with death . 
- You 're crazy , let me go ! 
- Stealing such material isn 't a crime . 
I 've already felt this damn sensation . 
I have taken away your only wealth and now you must kill me ! 
You 're pathetic . 
Kill the creature immediately and return to base to report .

It was disaster ! 
Now this quiet garden after those hellish machines ! 
- My dear , do not live for the dead . 
- You have died down on me ? 
Children always hear about the dead . 
- So much lost time ! 
He was a villain ! 
Already tired ? 
Never worry , ma 'am . 
Go to hell . 
It may seem strange but I have sad reasons . 
- The hell with it ! 
This is insane . 
But proof that there is doubt in the minds of all ! 
Death , gentlemen of the jury , is all he deserves ! 
What if Landru died ? 
All this waiting is difficult , no ? 
Don 't regret it . 
Don 't give me that crap ! 
That I 'm about to die ? 
The vain one ? 
A steal ! 
He was spending his life in prison . 
Yes , and if we have to do some killing .. ..

I would not like to appear old , or rude .

Partial collapse of the chest cavity to the right .

You are the weakest link , goodbye ! 
The Time War ends . 
Are you threatening me ? 
And I destroyed half her life . 
Blind Martha . 
The prophecies of women are limited and dull . 
It’ s a bad attack of rheumatism . 
What’ s the problem ? 
The rest will be broken up . 
Until then , the problem will keep . 
They could have landed here by accident . 
They’ il have weapons - weapons we can use . 
Well , that’ s no reason to sound downhearted . 
I know that , but where did he stop ? 
Well , then stop getting irritable ! 
Of course I’ m irritable . 
No ... no ... no , there wasn’ t . 
It is unpleasant to admit but our opposition is weak and unarmed . 
We’ d be fooling ourselves to believe otherwise . 
No eyes no head , it seems though . 
Death you see has it’ s own particular posture and appearance . 
It is dead isn’ t it ? 
It’ s dead alright - stiff as a poker . 
Ian I counted six of those dead ants . 
Let me do it , you might hurt yourself . 
That’ s not thunder surely ? ! 
I’ ve seen a lot more of those dead ants , Doctor . 
Are you sure he is dead ? 
Nothing but death all around us ! 
Destroying the last years work that’ s what it means . 
An awful smell of chemical in there ! 
I’ il have a shocking bruise on my knee though . 
I don’ t fancy struggling around there in the dark . 
You look very tired . 
Start a fire , my boy ! 
No no no no , I’ ve had a good look at this . 
No no my dear boy , no . 
I know how badly you want to get off this planet . 
If he finds out , he’ il kill both of us . 
My writing gets worse and worse ! 
The executioner sounds disappointed . 
You wouldn’ t be any worse off than you are now . 
Oh , I’ ve never felt better in my life ! 
She killed Sandy . 
She thought you were going to be hurt . 
The girl didn’ t know I’ d been arrested . 
If you fail , you die . 
It will do no harm to make enquiries , Didius . 
It won’ t hurt , I got it in the market specially . 
Not bad at all . 
Swords are dangerous , you know . 
Fail me again and you’ il lose more than your tongue ! 
If you escape and you’ re recaptured it would mean your death . 
It’ s quite a problem , Poppaea . 
It must be dangerous too . 
Fool ! 
I have every reason to believe that drink is poisoned ! 
He’ s all right but he’ s not all that good ! 
How dare he make a fool of me ! 
Infiltrate , separate and kill . 
You’ ve beaten them ! 
Awful noise indeed , huh ! 
He ... he got a bad knock on the head . 
There ain 't no need to get sore . 
No ... no ... no , no ! 
Otherwise we all might be killed . 
You dumb fool ! 
They have already killed one of us . 
Look , were you instructed to be killed as well ? 
To fight , to kill . 
My only intention was to scare it off . 
Oh , ho ho , you worry too much ! 
We 'd be in trouble ! 
We have a prisoner . 
Die ? 
The only one there I destroyed . 
I do nothing of the kind ! 
He is not the one to look for trouble , are you , boy ? 
No , the Doctor will stop him . 
After I am dead , Odysseus , and only then . 
If you kill me now , it will probably cost you the war . 
Shall he then be put to death ? 
Kill this Trojan spy . 
He feared to face me . 
To fight that fool ? 
Look at Paris - handsome as the devil , but a complete coward . 
My boy makes these to annoy his tutors . 
I propose to fire you over the walls of Troy ! 
That has brought us nothing but good luck . 
No ... ... die . 
You forced me to invent this contraption . 
Stop struggling woman ! 
That I was to die . 
No , Sara , it wouldn 't stop him coming here . 
Attack formation . 
What went wrong ? 
There is so much chaos going on ... and now it is too late . 
All this hysteria is unnecessary . 
Our people will kill us ! 
He 's mad ! 
But you 're an enemy . 
He said they were evil ! 
Wasting my time ! 
I would hate to have to lose you . 
We can 't crash now ! 
No , no , the Doctor has it . 
A technical fault ? 
Something 's gone wrong . 
" When a poor man came in sight , gathering winter fu- el ! " 
They 've obviously got themselves into some kind of trouble . 
Two fools rushed over there somewhere . 
Are the other two creatures to be present at the destruction ? 
A very bad break . 
Revenge is a strange thing , isn 't it ? 
The enemy ship ! 
You 're wasting your time . 
And then we wouldn 't have all this trouble . 
- There 's the edge of the petrified jungle . 
They 're based on fear , and fear breeds hatred ... and war . 
There 's no better argument against war than that . 
- Let 's see what he 's up to . ... they could even kill you . 
If I don 't get the fluid link back , the four of us will die . 
I could always have destroyed it if you 'd decided differently . 
Well I must say , this is most unprofessional ! 
I certainly disapprove of violence ! 
Not bad , not bad . 
Kill the next one that moves ! 
Nothing will ever induce me to raise a gun in anger . 
Think I wanna see my own sons killed ? 
Tramp found dead in Covent Garden . 
Deadly danger facing us ! 
Fire ! 
She therefore must be sent back to WOTAN to be punished . 
Oh come on , the boy 's been suffering some sort of delusion ! 
Don 't let 's waste any more time arguing ! 
Some kind of killer machine I 'm told . 
Don 't worry Sir Charles , my lads can handle it . 
You any idea what caused the collapse , gentlemen ? 
I allowed a prisoner to escape . 
Does he still say they 'll attack at noon ? 
- A danger 's approaching ! 
There 's nothing you can do for the poor fellow . 
Oh where the devil 's he gone ! 
- Then we 're in for trouble . 
- That wasn 't bad , was it ? 
What 's worse , the alligators here or the Daleks up there ? 
- People always lie when they 're starving ! 
Sorry to interrupt . 
( RlCHARD ) I hate it . 
That shantung suit looks awful . 
- Tired , are you ? 
I 'd rather be dead than work down here . 
It doesn 't matter to them whether you live or die . 
Running like hell ! 
They didn 't bother to kill us . 
- Don 't worry , Grandfather . 
It 's in a dreadful muddle . 
That one was dangerously close ! 
There isn 't time to argue ! 
Resistance is useless ? 
- The new bomb ? 
Don 't be a fool ! 
That 's where the Daleks operate on the prisoners . 
There is something quite scary about it . 
You 're dead ! " 
( GARY ) As you say , implied violence ! 
( CAROLE ) This really is nasty . 
I worked with Julian Chagrin . 
If anyone 's gonna cry , it 's gonna be me . 
No- one 's gonna look for you here , since you hate me so much ! 
Oh , tell your stupid boyfriend we 're busy . 
But you 'll destroy the planet . 
Trapped in your box ? 
EMERGENCY SlRENS APPROACH Hang on ! 
Is Brian threatening to leave again ? 
You have to get me out before they kill me again ! 
Stolen . 
You 're telling me you 've come back from the dead ? 
You dreamt you could hold back death . 
And I will die unless we bring him back here . 
Oh ... NO ! 
If the Eye isn 't closed , this planet will be sucked through it ! 
Don 't be a fool . 
I held back death ! 
Life is wasted on the living ! 
Don 't be scared . 
Damn it , say something ! 
Prisoner 2398 returning to camp from SS tailoring .

You look as if something unpleasant has happened to you . 
- That 's madness , Gertrud . 
You said ... not free ? 
This is worse . 
I have never loved another . 
I was ashamed and loathed being a woman . 
Nothing but death . 
- No , alone . 
I 'm so tired ... so tired . 
Why do you torture me ? 
You think a lot about death and the grave ? 
Dump the waitress ! 
- He kills me . 
Everyone needs somebody to worry about them . 
- What 's dirty about that ? 
Now go on out there and give 'em hell . 
Don 't worry , he 's not leaving yet . 
Why do you think she 's so upset ? 
- What the hell do you want ? 
- You can send this vulture home now . 
I 'm blind , you see . 
If I suddenly lose my wife , 
No offense , but you 're blind . 
I 'm blind and I 'm a drifter .

Nobody shoves dirty money in my mouth .

Ralph , I have this pain ... 
I 'd say it was more of a sharp pain . 
- This pain in my chest , is there a medical term for it ? 
I have never been so disillusioned with anyone in my whole life . 
I 'll catch my death of a cold . 
- I don 't believe you 've broken up . 
And you were nagging about the price of ham ! 
I feel nothing for you but ... pity .

Traveling alone must be hard when you 're blind . 
A blind man who used to be a masseur . 
A blind masseur getting a massage from a seeing man ? 
Scared someone will hear us ? 
You lying bastard . 
There might be a war with them soon . 
You must regret having taken in a drunk like me . 
But he 's just a blind man . 
As far as I 'm concerned , whether you call me blind or crippled , 
Just a blind man , as you can see . 
Poor fellow . 
- You 're going to kill me ? 
Damn it ! 
They died for no reason . 
He gave me all kinds of problems . 
I don 't want to continue such a ridiculous argument . 
Tomura is so stupid . 
I know I can 't survive if you 're killed . 
You look terrible . 
Izutu was killed . 
He broke into a cold sweat and shook all over . 
Bring us that blind masseur 's cane . 
He 's sick in bed . 
The is horrible as usual . 
Don 't worry . 
Mr. Ogi 's worries are over for now . 
Using sticks isn 't the art of combat ! 
The bigger the pain ! 
Bastard ! 
Really , that Ginzo hired one hell of a bodyguard ! 
Bad enough , taking a bath in broad daylight ! 
Don 't worry . 
Damn ! 
Stop blabbering , you blind bat ! 
Because the blind ... 
My whole gang destroyed ... 
This is a waste of time fuck shit shit . 
No , the smaller the needle ... ... the greater the pain !

If this blind bugger was headed up Mt . 
Why 'd you kill them ? 
Crap ! 
Damn it ! 
You think that stingy son of a bitch will agree ? 
- It 's no use playing dumb with me .

Poor Val .

You don 't interrogate a grieving father ! 
I got a problem in this squad , David . 
Are you telling me this chair will lose its weight ? 
You never spoke of your plans to go on this lunatic expedition ... 
Is he dead ? 
It 's a sort of suspended animation .

Well , I am quite devastated , as you can see . 
When you did it , you didn 't feel disgust , eh ? 
Poor Matilde ! 
- A misunderstanding . 
Why does your brother want to kill him ? 
May I drop dead ! 
Why would I kill Peppino ? 
Not bad . 
Damn ! 
You 've made me angry !

My hours are so crazy . 
Look , I hate to say no , but I 'm scared ... of the concierge . 
You Iook reaIly tired . 
You were driving , I became frantic . 
WhY waste time ? 
There 's a misunderstanding . 
You almost hated me .

Get your hands the hell off that stick , kid ! 
He died about ... 2 : 30 this afternoon . 
Oh , some houses just die . 
No trouble . 
I 'd kill him with my bare hands . 
Like hell I 'll take it . 
lf we get arrested 
That 's the villains . 
Oh , I think I 'm going to be sick . 
To replace the one who got killed ? 
The picture killed them , or should I say Rina did ? 
You 've got nothing to gain by marrying him . 
Oh , you dirty , filthy , perverted monster . 
Waist guns , tail guns , bomb bay . 
Oh , well , nobody could hate you , Miss Marlowe . 
Twice as irritating , they say . 
She died 20 minutes ago . 
She was doomed from the start , Nevada . 
I 'm ashamed . 
Let me worry about that . 
A thousand times the worse , to want thy light . 
That 's an awful thing to say . 
No , I 'm trembling . 
I hate the boulevards . 
Don 't cry . 
" As big a liar as ever ! " 
They 're testing a new idiot detector . 
Shut the hell up , ma 'am . 
You 're completely nuts !

They 've abducted her as a means of making an appeal 
Stupid farmers 
But your daughter will die first 
They 've always deceived us with trickery 
If it looks hopeless , forget about us 
Good , you should be able to kill farmers 
I did as you asked , and didn 't kill him 
He 's suffering 
I can 't let Shiba die 
Ine , I 'm the one who killed your husband

Samurai aren 't executed for killing peasants . 
Your punishment is lifted . 
Is it disgusting you ? 
Those peasants didn 't do anything wrong ! 
This bitch will be our toy . 
You 're stupid . 
I listened to you and didn 't sentence him to death . 
I never saw anyone so stupid . 
The administrator had them killed . 
The three samurai must be dead before that . 
- I 'm sick of it ! 
I don 't like the kill I never carry cartridges . 
- Then it 's bad news . 
- Somebody is killing somebody . 
I ' know he 's unhappy and ill . 
When he 's so ill . 
I 'm ill . 
Until I 'd been hurt . 
- To hurt me . 
- Why are you crying ?

Two hundred years ago the Goules were our fiercest enemies . 
And there is a decision which I can no longer delay . 
She brought you such pain . 
Since she could not love me . 
He must hate me very much . 
And if I die , then the gods are not with me . 
What a marriage without love can mean . 
Put aside your weapons and 
He is dead . 
Yet now you must die . 
Two hundred years ago the Gauls were our fiercest enemies .

I take these things badly . 
I don 't want any more doomed men . 
It 's killing me . 
- Like hell , you 're not . 
They had been selfish . 
War isn 't hell at all . 
A lot of men are going to get killed on D- day , Charlie . 
Not such a bad deal . 
I 'm sticky as hell . 
You know , Harry , you are a pompous ass ! 
A movie to show the first dead man on Omaha Beach was sailor ? 
- and this unhappy matter will be closed . 
Now what is so crazy about a tomb for the Unknown Sailor ? 
Damn it , Charlie . 
Don 't be an ass . 
How the hell do I know ? 
The first dead man on Omaha Beach is alive . 
- What 's wrong ? 
I want people to know I was a coward . 
What went wrong ? 
Why should I be angry ? 
The weapons must get through to the other units . 
He was in pain , so I had to shoot him . 
Then we can assume that Bergman is dead . 
Tell them to plan their attack for tomorrow .

Rather undisciplined , but I can 't criticize her . 
It was a car accident . 
She 's the only one who seems distressed . 
- This was for poor Isabella . 
Maybe she was killed too and hidden who knows where . 
All the men have been detained and I 'm sure one is the murderer . 
Go now , and don 't worry . 
And I killed Greta to give you an alibi . 
We 'll never have any peace until we give the police the culprit . 
Do you still think you can fool me ?

No , I didn 't forget it . 
Don 't torture yourself . 
I don 't think you can ever get me angry again . 
They consider it unfair competition . 
No , no , there is a cove at the north end . 
Only this time , no boats and no trick waders . 
It snaps and it hurts . 
Don 't worry . 
Oh , it just makes me mad !

I 'm sorry , but I must insist on pointing out the dangers . 
I mentioned to you that poor Mr Folly Hardwicke was troubled . 
- Any more of these weapons aboard ? 
The classic situation - thieves fall out . 
A mousetrap primed with a deadly poison ? 
- You mean ... a swindle . 
I was so worried , I just couldn 't stay away ! 
The captain , you know , does not encourage visitors . 
L" m sorry , but I must insist on pointing out the dangers . 
L" m terribly sorry .

I could 've killed him . 
We got real trouble this time . 
I ain 't gonna take that gun away from you , Miss Charlotte . 
- Does it insult you to remember that ? 
And now he 's gonna lose both . 
No , no . 
I could have killed him . 
We got real trouble this time . 
I 'm very ill . 
I 'm stony broke - is that the phrase ? 
Charlotte , don 't you cry 
And every night after I shall die 
- No , no . 
You didn 't fool me then , and you don 't fool me now . 
No , no . 
Charlotte , don 't you cry 
What a terrible thing . 
I 'm terribly sorry . 
We can 't be that selfish ! 
Someone tried to murder the Maestro . 
And there he lies now , sleeping in shameless nudity . 
Our inner bitterness is showing . 
Maestro Felix is very jealous . 
- Tristan , you still hate our Felix ? 
That day he defeated me . 
So that poor Jilker and Beatrice can get a programme . 
What - you 're the angry one here ? 
At last , some reason in the madness . 
- And undoubtedly very poor .

As you know , I have many enemies . 
Leave me chained here by my hair until I starve ? 
I should find it a most depressing kind of work . 
If I lose this job , then we don 't see each other anymore . 
No , no , I don 't . 
- Kill him . 
You 're lying . 
Liar . 
- Why are you always lying to me ? 
This one 's for you , bitch .

I ain 't no trouble at all . 
That we should feel guilty about . 
A coward 's survival , and at what a price ! 
You want me to come cry with you ? 
The hell with your crying . 
I didn 't die . 
What the hell are you saying ? $1 . 00 . 
What do you do to me then , you kill me ?

It 's a cruel world . 
People have sunk so low . 
She broke our rule . 
Damn . 
Filthy bitch ! 
Just don 't get desperate and do something reckless . 
I 'm 40 now , and tired of being my father- in- law 's slave . 
You said your brother died there . 
I always worry I might lose it . 
Bastard ! 
That O- Machi is such a bitch ! 
That last guy really stank ! 
She broke our rule 
Can we punish her , Sen ? 
I could kill them ! 
Your brother died there ? 
They all marched off to die 
Damned Ibuki ! 
It 's a cruel world .

Golden cockerel ... lame . 
That 's useless unless you know the right people . 
What did you think , fool ? 
I was tired of the cockfighting rinks . 
If you 're tired we can continue tomorrow . 
Don 't be sad . 
3 of swords , you lose . 
Let me take him to the fights tomorrow .

You know I hate melodramatics . 
Stop bothering the poor girl . 
I can 't help but feel jealous . 
You 've become Death 's mistress ! 
Real men don 't cry . 
It 's been fifteen days since Lenita died . 
They 're weak because they fear what they don 't know . 
Murderer ! 
Don 't worry . 
Later they regret it . 
Don 't worry . 
You Broke My Heart When You Broke My Comb . 
Who the devil told him to talk ? 
lf it 's yours , you can lose it . 
- or committing suicide . 
You should calm down because I get upset if he 's upset . 
- Look , the kid is really not that great ... 
In spite of this silly costume , 
Oh , don 't worry . 
Oh , your little Eddie was no trouble at all . 
Oh , you mean about her problem with boys ? 
Poor devil . 
You do look dead on your feet . 
Don 't worry about it . 
Devil 's food cake . 
Too bad they closed it down . 
And , oh , what a dreadful haircut . 
I don 't know how you could 've gotten the wrong idea . 
Fanny , stop being so jealous . 
Don 't be a sore loser . 
I have some weight to lose in a hurry . 
Lily , you shouldn 't have gone to so much trouble . 
Oh , that shouldn 't worry us now , Herman . 
[ Crash ] 
Grandpa , don 't you know that curiosity killed the bat ? 
But don 't worry . 
Charlie Munster , you ought to be ashamed of yourself . 
- Now , what 's wrong with that ? 
They 're just dead . 
Move it , stupid . 
No , no , no , no , no ! 
Grandpa , I drove all the way around the block . 
Oh , don 't worry . 
I shook her , but she just lies there . 
The spell can be broken . 
[ Chokes ] 
You might say she 's the ugly duckling . 
This is the ugly duckling ? 
Ooh , you might get them to give you a vulture egg shampoo . 
Don 't worry , Herman . 
- [ Both Scream ] 
No , no , no , no . 
" Cold , cruel world . " 
I 'll bring him back , dead or alive . 
Poor Grandpa . 
Poor Grandpa . 
I don 't want the poor lamb ever to know . 
Poor man . 
Lily , now don 't you worry about a thing . 
Business has been kind of dead all week . 
[ Grandpa Whines ] 
[ Whines Softly ] 
[ Whines ] 
[ Whines ] 
- Uh , no , no , Grandpa . 
I 'll be so embarrassed . 
Don 't worry . 
No one 's gonna fool me the second time . 
Don 't worry . 
Very unprofessional . 
Temper . 
All right , drown . 
You can 't let me drown . 
You 're a rat and a rat fink and a miserable little brat . 
They cast spells , practice sorcery and give people the evil eye . 
Don 't worry about a thing , Lily . 
You know , I 've always been rotten with prairie dogs . 
Lily , have no fear . 
Couldn 't that be a little dangerous ? 
They ran into some kind of trouble on the street . 
And then suddenly from the other room you hear a scream . 
Uh , but it 's not my sweetheart again . 
You know , if you keep this up , I might get very angry . 
- And , Herman , don 't feel badly on my account . 
I 'd hate to lose my parlor pallor . 
After all , a fella who works in a vault can 't be all bad . 
I was dead to the world . 
You had such a terrible experience ! 
We 'll prosecute later . 
Oh , this is terrible ! 
Oh , that is the most ridiculous story I have ever heard ! 
You 're just jealous because Eddie volunteered me instead of you . 
[ Crash ] 
My mother irons and my father steals . 
Drop dead . 
For once in this family , let 's let the dead stay buried . 
It 's a shame Uncle Herman has to work this hard . 
We were just all upset about you working so hard . 
Uh , then put more dirty clothes in washer . 
Including my rotten ol ' father- in- law . 
This a real little devil ! 
I should have cut my fingernails No ? 
Did someone insult you ? 
- What’ s wrong with that ? 
You have no reason to insult me . 
I’ m afraid that I’ m much more stupid myself 
You are not my wife and not my lover . 
You’ re crying ? 
My maid was just killed ! 
- Not only guilty end up on a scaffold . 
You have a choice sword or poison . 
Prefer poison ? 
They are so bored in that barn ? 
Don’ t hurt your brother . 
Who is for death penalty ? 
This is why I was arrested . 
Here no one will harm you even the King . 
The cart blocking the gate ! 
- You 're mad ! 
A horrible thing ! 
- You worry me . 
And a stone found in a toad 's skull changes color in poison ? . 
I know some who have swallowed them and choked to death . 
Are you crying ? . 
Peyrac is insane to boast to my cousin . 
I stole the poison and a pact signed by the plotters . 
I 'll find that bitch again , and I shall have her ! 
I 'm terribly sorry for having wasted your time . 
My servant 's just been murdered ! 
- What is wrong ? . 
Sword or poison ? . 
It 's a virulent poison . 
It 's the same poison which was meant for you when you were 15 . 
No doubt . 
They 'll kill you ! 
They killed my servant and tried to kill me . 
I had trouble finding him . 
Ten times did he scream . 
They can murder my wife . 
The stupid men in this town ! 
Perhaps its a thief . 
Its such a shame we sold the farm . 
They must have had an accident ! 
Somebody must be sick . 
Poor woman ... 
They got us each the same one , cause you were jealous of me . 
But now that Kike 's dead , I don 't think its right . 
This wine would raise the dead ! 
Disgusting ! 
Oh ! right -- you 're in mourning ! 
No , no ! 
It might seem ridiculous to you making you sneak in like a thief . 
Don 't cry , I hate tears . 
Have I treated you that badly ! 
A corset has been stolen from me ! 
She 's dead . 
[ plates crash ] 
Its dangerous . 
Matt , I don t worry about omens when you re around . 
- The story is dead . 
Matt , there II be no trouble . 
Oh , a tragedy that Lili . 
No , no relative . 
- Any other problem ? 
WeIl , I spanked her when she was bad , 
- Lili s getting tired ! 
It 's dangerous . 
Matt , I don 't worry about omens when you 're around . 
- The story is dead . 
If we lose that canvas we re out of business . 
- That 's too bad . 
Matt , there 'll be no trouble . 
Oh , a tragedy that Lili . 
No , no relative . 
- Any other problem ? 
When I came in I wanted to kill you . 
- Lili 's getting tired ! 
If it 's something a blind man can do ... 
So an eyeless daruma becomes a blind man 's companion . 
It 's really that bad ? 
Such mischief , in broad daylight ! 
Get out of here , you deadbeat drunk ! 
This chokes me up . 
- You think he might be dead ? 
I know it was wrong . 
I don 't want to die . 
I can 't kill the man who gave me that . 
It 's dangerous to draw your sword . 
That blind masseur ! 
What a cruel woman . 
Zatoichi , you found a nice place to hide with your whore . 
Go now , or you 'll lose sight of them . 
Why are they going to kill Ichi ? 
That bastard sold us out . 
Elder brother , do you really hate me so much ? 
I get mixed up in unpleasant matters . 
If it 's something a blind man can do ...

Don 't worry , Shizu . 
Fool ! 
That 's not anything foryou to worry about . 
No sense in getting hurt . 
And what a fool Bunkichi was ! 
He was a dead man no matterwhat he did . 
I 'm a blind man , so I couldn 't see it even if it were a show . 
Don 't worry , Shizu . 
Fool ! 
That 's not anything for you to worry about . 
No sense in getting hurt . 
And what a fool Bunkichi was ! 
He was a dead man no matter what he did .

Nor would I expect priority over vitally needed war transport . 
Mademoiselle Villard has a problem . 
- Fault in the oil line . 
Do you want everyone killed ?

Against the Red Death ? 
Prince , spare me the Red Death . 
For some of you are guilty of acts against us . 
You would destroy yourself for him ? 
You killed them . 
It 's only Hop Toad ... made more ugly than even he is . 
I will tie him up and make him helpless . 
The dance of death .

No , I have faulty equilibrium .

- No , no , no , certainly not , Henry . 
We 've been assigned to Commander Harlock 's destroyer . 
It concerns the liaison problem ... ... with the secret weapon . 
Dead ahead .

Sorry for my incompetence 
It 's my fault to call on you so suddenly 
Don 't worry , Zhaojun 
Rather than have millions weep , I 'd suffer myself 
I know the new frontier is harsh 
Would even go to the war ... if that 's what you want 
We 've put away many criminals 
Just write something and go It 's so damn cold 
What 's wrong ? 
There wiII be no rebels if His Majesty serves his people 
If it 's worse it 's a sign it 's nearly over . 
I don 't want no gold and no diamonds . 
Wicked girl ... and the angels will weep for you ! 
She becomes jealous , exacting , suspicious and a damn nuisance .

And I mean to go on bein ' undeserving .

Most men are the marrying sort , poor devils . 
I don 't want to run the risk of them being missed . 
You 've caused me enough trouble for one morning .

I 've learned something from your idiotic notions . 
You find me cold , unfeeling , selfish , don 't you ?

So you came here to rescue her from worse than death , eh ? 
- He 'll make bad use of it , I 'm afraid . 
Have a little cry and say your prayers . 
Most men are the marrying sort , poor devils . 
I don 't want to run the risk of them being missed . 
Freddy , you don 't think I 'm a heartless guttersnipe , do you ? 
She 's no relation , no . 
You 've caused me enough trouble . 
I 've learned something from your idiotic notions .

She 's no relation , no . 
You 've caused me enough trouble . 
I 've learned something from your idiotic notions . 
Even if I had deceived you , you had no right . 
Of infinite sadness , 
It was a silly thing to do , to rape me and to slap me . 
Impatience . 
You 're sad all of a sudden . 
DEATH ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN 
Not to tell her a lie , I just said ' Sad movies make me cry . ' 
Your fears are now confirmed . 
I 'm an idiot . 
It 's not so easy . 
These cruel meetings that weren 't meant for me . 
He was scared of me . 
Even if I 'd cheated on you , you had no right . 
- You 're mad ! 
I 'm scared . 
An infinite sadness . 
There was no need to rape me , or to slap me around . 
You 're sad all of a sudden . 
DEATH ON CREDlT 
I 'm scared of seeing him naked . 
When the film is sad . 
When the film is sad . 
It makes me cry . 
Your fears have been confirmed . 
I 'm scared . 
- Nothing , I 'm being stupid . 
Do you think he 'd scare me ? 
If you must die , die in beauty . 
As a morbid , gloomy lunatic . 
- Don 't make it worse for him . 
Nobody died from a two day fast . 
I 'm wasting time here ... 
Don 't worry . 
Don 't worry about your fiancée . 
She wanted to kill us by tampering with the car . 
Don 't make his case worse than it is , huh ? 
It 's such a waste to lock me in this dungeon now ! 
Your death will take my secret to the grave . 
After the flowers of evil , the blue flowers are a charm ... 
No , he had a sadistic look . ... like a savage beast ! 
I have such a bad taste in the mouth ! 
He tried to kill us by sabotaging the car ...

She wanted to kill us by tampering with the car . 
He dumped a bunch of books when he moved ... 
Can 't help but cry . 
Shall we die together ? 
But he just suddenly died ? 
Don 't be angry if I got it right 
No , no , you 're not 
With Da Gui 's hot temper 
If you don 't do it , things might go wrong 
Or go and get that broken boat right now 
Drunk I am indeed ! 
Oh , that 's no problem 
I just want to say if I had done anything wrong 
Drunkard , a useless drunkard 
I want to work for him even you beat me to death 
Beating up that Qin guy 
She 's lying . 
" Having stolen my heart , " " you hide yourself from me " 
Mothing wrong . 
" When I 'm in pain , he cries " 
I 'm sorry to be refusing you 
" Don 't be sad . 
You 're always singing that sad song 
" I could call the sun , " " but the sun is not perfect " 
" I fear that I might die " " waiting for you to be mine " 
Shame on you 
Dead ... ? 
This is painful 
All this window shopping is going to kill us 
" My life is ruined " " because of my old man " 
" Without either of you , " life would be miserable 
" For a while , I was taken for dead " 
Kill me if you want to ! 
I can 't bear your pain 
" I could bear my own pain , " but I can 't bear his pain 
Have you gone mad ?

I wouldn 't have minded being killed for revenge . 
Stop it if you don 't wanna die . 
Are you planning to have a baby with the enemy ? 
I swear to kill you someday ! 
It 's a cruel thing but otherwise your life will be in danger . 
You don 't necessarily have to die young . 
Don 't die . 
Please , don 't kill him . 
- Bastard ! 
Then kill both of us before you go . 
Last time they sent him away , we fought a terrible battle ! 
He 's not better , believe me ! 
I didn 't want to teach you this job , that 's so bloody . 
Like hell it is ! 
It 's as if it 's firing from underground ! 
Watch that grenade and stop staring like an idiot ! 
Fire in front of him , towards Kosanin Grad !

Premier Kissoff 's calling again and he 's hopping mad . 
The operating circuits are dead , sir . 
- Is it that bad ? 
Goldy , did you say Wing Attack Plan R ? 
- and the international Communist conspiracy - 
And though I hate to judge before the facts are in , - 
' Otherwise we will be destroyed by Red retaliation . ' 
But no more than 10- 20 million dead . 
- Were you ever a prisoner of war ? 
- Did they torture you ? 
I was tortured by the Japanese . 
Premier Kissoff 's calling and he 's hopping mad . 
The operating circuits are dead . 
L 'd hate to have to decide who stays up and who goes down . 
There 'll be no shocking memories , just a feeling of nostalgia . 
- Is it that bad , sir ? 
Goldie , did you say Wing attack Plan R ? 
Otherwise , we will be totally destroyed by Red retaliation . 
But I do say no more than 10 to 20 million killed . 
This clumsy fool tried to plant that ridiculous camera on me . 
I 'm just calling up to tell you something terrible has happened . 
The doomsday machine is designed to trigger itself automatically .

I 'm sick of dark old churches . 
You don 't have to worry about this measly old job . 
- No , no . 
I was just beside myself with anger . 
I told her that was no part of no driver 's job . 
We 're there , Peebie , your troubles are over . 
Died with his boots on , though . 
You 're completely broke , huh ? 
I was beating time with my cane and my cane slipped . 
- No , no , no . 
But it made a scandal . 
And gets me fired ? 
Well , who the hell isn 't ? 
Don 't you worry , honey . 
Oh , hell , it was only pesos . 
The last thin thread that bound him there ... ... is broken . 
- A man can die of panic . 
Broken barriers between people . 
No , no , I don 't mind answering . 
He 's still struggling . 
We 'll cut the lizard loose so that he can go back to his bushes .

Which is a bigger tragedy , that or Romeo and Juliet ? 
- No , " Darkness of the Sun . " 
Why waste time talking ? 
I can 't tell you how shamelessly he 's been exploiting my name . 
No , no . 
Is this a bigger tragedy or is it Romeo and Juliet ? 
The trouble is , I can 't spare any time to guide her . 
It 's too disturbing . 
What 's the point in wasting time talking ? 
I killed a priest on the way back and put on his clothes . 
No different than an enemy . 
You hate me for returning alone ? 
You kill people for a living . 
You worthless bastard , coming back here alone ! 
Hachi saw him die . 
When the war ends , the men will come back . 
Hell must exist . 
I feared marring my face . 
Men like you killed my son ! 
Even weasels can fool people . 
Now I 'm being punished for it ! 
Not our war . 
Steal them ? 
I killed a priest on the way and put it on .

But they haven 't beaten me . 
Punish him , too . 
Nonsense .

Punish him , too . 
Put everything inside , so that the sun doesn 't ruin it . 
Don 't despair Miss Bat- Sheva . 
It was really hard to say no . 
- lf you have any problems , 
He 's a dangerous dog . 
Theodore , I want to cry . 
Symphony in minor all day on radio to drive you mad . 
Come on woman , don 't cry . 
- A riding accident . 
Imagine if it’ s stolen from us ! 
His Excellency’ s disconsolate widow . 
Poor Constantin . 
What a terrible misfortune , madam !

Can I steal some of your coffee ? 
The white man 's words are lies ! 
War is his life . 
Then you 're a damned idiot . 
Well , that doesn 't give you a personal license to kill Indians . 
I 'd rather force them to attack us . 
Bellies will be full and no longer will we be alone . 
Are you still calling me a liar or ain 't you ? 
Where the hell did you get that ? 
Like we 're trying to kill Indians just because they 're Indians . 
We will die before we reach our homeland . 
None of them had to die .

If they miss , we 'll have a war . 
Leave quietly and no one gets hurt . 
As long as I hate you , I 've got taste . 
- Don 't be resentful . 
Steals from the rich and gives to the poor ! 
That would be a catastrophe . 
Destroy it ! 
Sin and gin got me in its clutches . 
You , brother , you can drop dead . 
- Will he do anything rash ? 
But I can 't fight Robbo alone . 
Why , that dirty -

Maybe that 's a bad thing to say ! 
So , you can afford to lose seven of them ? 
There were no battles , no fortresses . 
They suspected this child had died of natural causes . 
We didn 't know if it was toxic , might even have caused cancer . 
I 'm probably going to be hell to live with . 
You 're fired ! 
- A chimpanzee on my block . 
That picture makes me sick ! 
It 's a terrible thing , being so dumb . 
Then , the fatal thing happened . 
- Are you faced with ruin ? 
I was terrified . 
Just looking at Pinky made me want to cry . 
I 'm gonna lay an awful egg . 
- Wrong ?

Poor Ludwig . 
Are you faced with ruin ? 
What the hell is it ? 
I 'm an old man but I 'm nobody 's fool , sir . 
- No complaints . 
No , no , no . 
Sad about Uncle Otto . 
- Don 't worry . 
- My fault ? 
No depth , no . 
Sam , you are jealous . 
- if he hadn 't made the wrong discard . 
No , no . 
- Denied . 
- Nonsense . 
Does it hurt ?

He was the worst saílor ín the navy . 
This lunatic scheme will destroy us all ! 
- No ribs broken . 
What seems to be your problem , Mr Hodges ? 
- Sabotage ... 
Sent a minisub into a minefield , killing two of my men . 
In my judgment , you 're faking . 
- Rig for attack ! 
Fools ! 
- If the missile isn 't fired in six minutes , we ... 
A very difficult role for me . 
You know it 's hopeless . 
No , you 're wrong , Admiral . 
Another two minutes it 'll be crushed to powder . 
The worst is over . 
- Trouble ? 
We were separated during the attack . 
I wouldn 't want to get you into any more trouble . 
There 's no place left to run ... or hide . 
Dr. Melton , I order you to kill yourself . 
In higher altitudes , this becomes somewhat dangerous . 
Nonsense . 
All he wants is revenge . 
It 's a terrible waste . 
I do not trust that man . 
That means the enemy forces can locate us . 
A most unfortunate accident ... but a necessary one . 
- How bad ? 
- Check all points in Damage Control . 
Unsuccessfully , of course ? 
Mr. Wesby will no doubt try to attend ! 
He almost arrested him ! 
Which you no doubt did , Madam ! 
24 hours later they found her dead ! 
No , no I 've had enough ! 
- Oh , isn 't that too bad ! 
- Lying ? 
One of us has been killed already . 
You remember how Hartford was murdered ? 
Not bad , eh , Mona ? 
Listen , Mac , I have just been aching for someone to talk to . 
Not enemy . 
Not bad , eh , Mona ? 
Listen , Mac , I have just been aching for someone to talk to . 
Not enemy . 
They 've destroyed our family , Ivanko , and you ... 
Princess , the guards will kill you . 
Find her and kill her . 
- Don 't worry , Tina , he 's beneath you . 
- I was invited to DOA . 
How in hell are we supposed to get up there ? 
Who the hell is that ? 
Christie kept stealing all the blankets . 
Even if that means I have to hurt you . 
Boy , am I sorry I messed with you so much . 
You almost made it to the semi- finals of DOA , Helena . 
That hurt . 
I think you 're one of the most selfish men I 've ever met . 
Yet capable of murder ? 
- You 're in a very weak condition . 
He was buried the day after you were taken ill . 
And jealous ? 
- Oh , you 're mad . 
Don 't worry . 
Bad temper ... 
Mix them and you get a dismal grey , which is more realistic . 
Social life is awful . 
To all dog- haters ! 
To all dog- haters ! 
I 'll get blood poisoning ! 
I know what you want to tell me but you think I 'll be hurt . 
He 's at war with himself , you , anyone who gets in his way . 
Then I 'll be the usual stupid priest . 
Strangled by the umbilical cord . 
I am furious . 
You oses to make me lose Ia face ? 
To remain hidden here is unworthy . 
All those which penetrate in this zone ... kill- Ies ! 
By your fault , Ia reconciliation is compromised . 
II remainder in life , II a threat represents . 
Thievery ! 
No point to complain . 
When Murata is in trouble , 
Ill go away . 
I am furious . 
All who enter this area kill them ! 
He will be a threat for the rest of our lives 
I will not be able to tell him he is in prison . 
Have you any idea how much trouble 
Those violent days are over . 
Will she grow ugly too ? 
No , I can forget it when I come to you . 
You 'll hate me now .

You 'll be killed immediately if you set a foot outside . 
Don 't scold them too much . 
They said I 'll be the one who 'll kill Sakai . 
I 'm the on who 'll kill Sakai . 
I 'm speechless in front of such a disaster . 
You 'll be killed immediately if you set a foot outside , 
Don 't scold them too much , 
They said I 'll be the one who 'll kill Sakai , 
It even suits me , I 'm the on who 'll kill Sakai , 
Your straightforwardness doesn 't fear or flater the power , 
Are you still mad at me ? 
I 'm speechless in front of such a disaster , 
If you see my face I 'll kill you ! 
- You want to get killed ? 
Little bastard ... 
The tiniest drop could kill you . 
If he doesn 't forgive me , I 'll kill myself ... 
But I 'll die soon ... 
I rang but no one answered . 
Don 't be an idiot ! 
I lose my temper easily . 
You 're causing me more trouble now ! 
When I had the heart attack on the train you gave me my medicine . 
- Stop lying . 
I 'll kill him and go as far as I can before I kill myself . 
I guess I 've brought you to a lousy place . 
- And she died , I heard . 
You used to steal food . 
I 'll kill you if you do ! 
- Want me to kill you ? 
Get out , you child of a whore ! 
But I 'm going to die . 
Here I am , so unhappy . 
It 's dark and dangerous near your apartment . 
Go to hell ! 
I called but there was no answer . 
Don 't be stupid ! 
I have suffered no damage . 
Why should I be mad ? 
It 's dirty . 
The cause of your problem is your wife 's problem . 
- That is the trouble , isn 't it ? 
Oh , that 's a disgusting lie . 
Ungrateful ? 
I 'm miserable . 
- No , no . 
It 's worse . 
But Frank and I have never been happier . 
Frank isn 't ugly , Mrs. Broderick . 
Also , I 'm accident prone . 
No , no , no , now , cool down . 
That 's the reason they fired me . 
It 's all that Bob Weston 's fault . 
I have suffered no damage . 
Why should I be mad ? 
It 's dirty . 
The cause of your problem is your wife 's problem .

We 've failed tonight . 
I didn 't steal it . 
Look at the scary people ! 
If my husband heard you , he 'd kill you . 
It even was not worth it to stop eating . 
Oh , don 't attack me ... 
- No , that 's a ghost ! 
The chimpanzee is dangerous . 
- And you 'll be fired ! 
I am prohibited from showing the phenomenon when she gets angry . 
- If that 's the worst in life .. 
No scandals . 
You were very rude a few days ago . 
I sing , I climb , I show my ass . 
Is that what they taught you in that awful place ? 
It 's sheer madness , I know . 
And the issues are quite difficult to foresee . 
No , no ! 
You irritate me ! 
And if it is an unfortunate child , isn 't it ours ? 
- You 're not happy with life ? 
Your daughter , as you know , died . 
Holy shit ! 
Don 't worry about it . 
Fag . 
And now you 're haunted by it , huh ? 
Some stupid piece of ass we forgot about 10 minutes later ? 
Go for broke . 
No , no , no . 
What the fuck happened to us ? 
She got sick a few years back and ... died . 
I can 't figure out what happened to the poor guy . 
And that is why we should not confuse goodness with weakness . 
And we 'll steal a getaway car . 
He 's so dirty . 
He threw my bike on the ground violently . 
- No dirt ? 
This is the moment of revenge and I know I can count on you . 
- No problem . 
Don 't worry . 
She 's not very happy with you , Ape . 
He said he dumped Hillary for Nicole . 
She 's a very sick girl . 
I think I 'm gonna be sick . 
For fuck 's sake . 
It 's no trouble . 
It wasn 't your fault . 
We couldn 't kill Imai ... 
Don 't let that worry you . 
I want someone to avenge Tamaki 's death . 
I 'm headed back to prison . 
It 's so meaningless . 
It was quite a scandal . 
When I see him , I 'll kill him . 
I 'll destroy him . 
I 'm broke . 
Are you talking nonsense now ? 
Very dangerous . 
- Bastard . 
I find that very unfriendly . 
But he can get angry , even in front of ladies . 
That 's pathetic . 
And this idiot can 't do it . 
It 's cruel . 
The shame ? 
I 'm not a benefactor , but a winner . 
A false statement at the start can ruin the entire investigation . 
Fire , fire . 
Damn , I should have called Sylvie . 
Could a criminal change ?

- No , miss . 
- No , no ! 
Fear not , Giselle ! 
What 's wrong ? 
Don 't worry . 
The steel beast is dead , peasants . 
He 's probably eaten some bad nuts . 
You feel you 'd die without me here . 
This is so unprofessional . 
Severely punished for it . 
- He tried to kill me ! 
Well , no wonder she 's angry . 
That 's too bad . 
No , no . 
- How could that be a problem ? 
What 's wrong ? 
Oh , I wouldn 't worry about Pip . 
I 'm angry ! 
Everybody has bad times . 
I can stop the hurt . 
I can make all those bad memories disappear . 
She poisoned her ! 
It almost killed me . 
If it is in the car , and whether they were distress signals ? 
I am trapped , address is 1132 Lenko ! 
Hey , how about this big old flop- flop ! 
- He thinks he 's blind . 
Practically killed the wino anyway . 
We all ought to be punished . 
Don 't kill me , I 'm not the lady . 
Are they dead ? 
I am trapped , address is 1132 Lenko ! 
Hey , how about this big old flop- flop ! 
- He thinks he 's blind . 
Practically killed the wino anyway . 
We all ought to be punished . 
Don 't kill me , I 'm not the lady . 
Are they dead ? 
We believe he committed suicide by drowning himself . 
Damn you ! 
You said Hachiro shows no sign of suspicious activity ? 
You seem to be struggling . 
That is your trouble . 
Um , what I 'm doing is probably mad . 
I understand it 's rather poor . 
Why start with the wrong foot ? 
so it was no mistake , even in the dark . 
I fought breasts to breasts ... but then came the bad times . 
Where the hell did I put it ? 
Don 't get me wrong . 
I don 't believe you give a damn about your country . 
They are such poor , weak creatures ... and it takes so little . 
- You stink of perfume , Mr. Zorba . 
This is for poor little Bouboulina . 
That is your trouble . 
And what I 'm doing is probably mad . 
I understand it 's rather poor . 
Why start with the wrong foot ? 
But then came the bad times .

I don 't believe you give a damn about your country .

He is bad . "

Sifface , you have just said nonsense . 
They would harm you . 
Why are you crying , my Lady ? 
- Is it him , who killed a soldier ? 
He doesn 't realize that blow , can kill a man . 
He hasn 't betrayed you , Caesar . 
Tell me , what 's the problem ? 
It may be the one they were torturing . 
We 've heard someone 's screams , coming from the torturing room . 
- Addosso , arrest him ! 
Ilteo , block that door . 
Don 't worry . 
- Why did you kill her , dirty pig ? 
Finally , you admit to have links with those murderers . 
I want to see him die , in the arena . 
I also fear . 
" You 're wrong , it is me who pays " . 
I can 't send a messenger , unhappily , with the most secret . 
So tired . 
Oh , crisis . 
I 'm mad about him , 
The illness was a lie , wasn 't it ? 
And you hate me even to touch you ? 
I can 't understand how it 's gone wrong . 
No photograph and no dining car . 
Stop , Stefano , stop . 
Only last week , another killing , another machine- gunning . 
Look , do you really mind whether I 'm unhappy or not ? 
- Oh , because she 'll be so jealous . 
Maybe he 'll just be dead , but he 'll be glad to be dead . 
I consider myself deeply in your debt . 
What about my dangerous moments ? 
I can 't send a messenger , unhappily , with the most secret .

You got my deepest condolences|and all that shit . 
- Get your ass down here . |- I gotta go . 
Bloody hell , Jack ! 
If you kill me , you 'll be on the run for the rest of your life . 
Things are going bad for me . 
- They made a fool of me . 
I 've hurt myself - Watch out . 
Don 't touch it , you 'll get dirty . 
He 's scared ... aren 't you ? 
Jarek , don 't make a fool of yourself . 
That stupid magician . 
- Kill her and cook her 
- All evil comes from them . 
No , no , no ... 
Poor animal . 
He killed her with that broom , can you see that ? 
Don 't be mad at me . 
My zipper is broken . 
He hates the shop ? 
Wasted ? 
What a waste ! 
He looks innocent but he 's stubborn . 
I 'd wasted my 18 years for the family . 
What an insult ! 
I could even go mad . 
I knew I was an idiot to give him your address . 
And to hell with you ! 
- You big fool . 
- How stupid of me , Dona Anna . 
I don 't want to be haunted all the time I 'm away . 
She terrifies me . 
Arsenic poisoning is often mistaken for a heart attack . 
You and Maggie killed Frank . 
The charge is suspicion of murder . 
What the hell kind of music is that ? 
That 's about nine hours after he died . 
I really want to cry over it all . 
I really want to cry over it all . 
Oh , you needn 't worry about it . 
It 's quite ridiculous . 
You look tired , John . 
Kill her !! 
It 's not very comfortable ! 
Not bad at aIl . 
I hate noisy bumble snow monsters . 
Oh , the poor kids . 
It 's not very comfortable ! 
Not bad at all . 
I hate noisy bumble snow monsters . 
Oh , the poor kids . 
It 's not very comfortable ! 
Not bad at aIl .

Oh , the poor kids . 
It 's not very comfortable ! 
Not bad at aIl . 
I hate noisy bumble snow monsters . 
Oh , the poor kids . 
Outrageous , isn 't it ? 
In war i lost everything : 
My heart is dying inside everyday when there is an attack ... 
Until pronounce the sentence , poor men can die 100 times . 
We broke up . 
To destroy the projector . 
Because you 'll send me to trouble . 
Because you agitate me . 
Oh ... you scared me ... 
I had forgotten there is a war going on . 
They can kill me if they want . 
Your deposition is terrible . 
It 's infected . 
I want to cry into your chest . 
Your heart 's beating faster already . 
You don 't have anything to fear , anyway . 
Not bad . 
Dead , both of them . 
No , someone will find a way to stop you . 
You don 't have anything to fear , anyway . 
Not bad . 
Dead , both of them . 
No , someone will find a way to stop you . 
The baby started to cry . 
Our purpose was to get inside the prison . 
It 's raw puke . 
I don 't know how it happened , but it is so painful . 
You 'll catch your death of pneumonia . 
My coat is on fire ! 
You fool ! 
Tastes very bad when you do that . 
Give me the prison superintendent immediately . 
Prison is bad enough without uncomfortable furniture . 
" That crazy Spaniard who raped me in my father 's field . " 
Stupid tailor . 
Madness reigns . 
We all pay for our sins . 
My hands are lethal weapons . 
I don 't know how it happened but it is painful . 
My coat is on fire ! 
You fool . 
There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever , Hercule . 
Stupid box . 
- They should have these chairs in prison . 
- Give me the prison superintendent . 
When are you going to do something about that terrible furniture ? 
Stupid tailor . 
Must I go back to prison ? unfortunately , yes . 
Madness reigns . 
- We all pay for our sins , don 't we ? 
I don 't know how it happened but it is painful .

Quickly , or I shall scream . 
Madness reigns . 
We all pay for our sins . 
Don 't worry , you didn 't . 
- I 'm terribly sorry .

- I 'm terribly sorry . 
Lena , don 't you realize this is tragedy ? 
- Forbidden to cuff or tuck . 
No , you seem like a pain in the ass . 
If you see death lurking in the hall , 
I mean , if I can decide to be resentful and jealous , 
- We need to be annoying and persistent . 
My stupid brothers hid my homework . 
No , no . 
My bitchiness ... that was self- taught . 
Dave , I know that you 're going through hell , 
Yeah , it 's so sad . 
If death were ever to steal one of my knickknacks . 
One 's sort of a pain in the ass . 
And then you bumped it on that nasty curb . 
Dan was denied financial aid at Yale . 
Let me remind you of a little thing called the Civil War . 
No strings , no demands ... 
No , no , no . 
I wouldn 't worry if I can 't find him 
No one 's killing anyone . 
You thought wrong . 
You 're enemies . 
But then again , we all knew your weakness for limos . 
Knowing you and Chuck were hanging out made me jealous . 
Maybe but I wouldn 't walk with a dead man shoes ! 
They 're totally wasted ! 
That 's really a scumbag ! 
I have to call him only if it turns bad . 
Shit ! 
- I 've got no pressure , what are you doing ? 
What a bastard ! 
- He can drop dead ! 
What a bitch ! 
Oh , yes , you are , devil in disguise . 
Oh , yes , you are , devil in disguise . 
' cause he 's no rebel , no , no , no . 
Now I think I 'd rather die than be the one to say we 'll part . 
Him and his childish tantrums . 
She might do something even worse . 
I 'm terribly sorry , but I 'm afraid I 'll have to leave . 
This evening was a fiasco . 
Take your mind off dumb dumb . 
You were wrong . 
Well , I am the dumb witch . 
No , I 'm not pretty . 
I 've been completely wrong about McTavish . 
It wouldn 't hurt to dicker a little . 
Don 't worry about it , Mom . 
And I 'm not saying that because I 'm prejudiced . 
Well , I 'd suggest an earthquake , but I doubt if it would work . 
No , no . 
What a shame . 
As I say , what a shame . 
Worry , worry . 
Oh , I have the same trouble . 
She probably woke up and started to cry . 
Unfortunately , it 's still Miss . 
- The very offensive fullback . 
Why would anyone want to murder you ? 
I 'm so frightened . 
I 'm calling to prevent a murder . 
She didn 't toss them in the waste . 
Is something wrong ? 
What a shame . 
Don 't be angry . 
I apologize for thinking you were that ugly bird . 
- He called me a liar . 
He 's a troubled child if you know what I mean . 
Norman , the guardian angel of fools and tired vaudeville acts . 
- Can 't tell me that was just an accident . 
I don 't know any poor lonely boys . 
Were you warned about me , or do I come as a horrible surprise ? 
Oh , it was terrible . 
It 's a rash he gets . 
You cured his rash ? 
There 's something wrong . 
If you hurt her feelings I 'll never forgive you . 
I 'll have lunch with Larry Tate and really be miserable . 
Oh , it wasn 't a bad day . 
As a matter of fact , it wasn 't a bad day . 
- No , no , not at all . 
Don 't be angry , Larry . 
Nonsense . 
- I 'm making a fool of myself ? 
Hello , Danger . 
" Nevermore any problems for your secretary . " 
Some accident . 
- That 's in bad taste , George . 
I hate to impose on you . 
What 's wrong with a witch being attracted to a mortal ? 
George , you failed me . 
I 'll send a note of regret this afternoon . 
And don 't worry , Gideon has everything under control . 
- You are in trouble , aren 't you ? 
I 'm terribly concerned about Mr. Stephens . 
Oh , no , no , not at all . 
Oh , I am sorry , but accidents will happen . 
It 's about the Civil War . 
I hate Brussels sprouts . 
- There 's been an accident ! 
They hate each other . 
Don 't you think your plan 's a little dangerous ? 
You really are jealous , aren 't you ? 
Darrin , you 're not exactly leaving your problems at the office . 
Isn 't that a bit unethical ? 
No use being upset about it , because that 's the way I feel . 
Thoroughly immoral and foolishly mortal . 
You 'll get sick . 
Well , nothing 's worth your killing yourself . 
- Besides , it was all my fault . 
Don 't feel too badly about Caldwell either . 
His problems are none of your business . 
This is our fault . 
Come on , Sam , there 's no time to lose . 
Grim . 
He doesn 't wanna hurt her feelings . 
Darrin , you 're being unnecessarily wilful and stubborn . 
It 's all our fault that your young man has lost his job . 
We find it distasteful and insulting . 
I 've never seen her this bad . 
Have no fear . 
He 's been called worse than that . 
It 's a shame you have to go to the office today . 
You 're jealous . 
Now , don 't worry about Samantha , Darrin . 
As a mother I 've apparently failed you completely . 
- Is something wrong ? 
If you 're lying , you ought to be ashamed of yourself . 
Oh , my poor feet . 
- Snooping , no doubt . 
- Coward . 
No trouble at all . 
Let out quite a scream , the little fellow did . 
- Doctor , I 'm in a terrible hurry . 
When somebody insults my wife , that 's as diplomatic as I get . 
I 've got a problem . 
I wouldn 't send my worst enemy on a trip with Louise . 
Poor chap had a nervous breakdown , we were only halfway there . 
- Is Samantha really unhappy ? 
Is that disagreeable little clerk still there ? 
It 's a disgrace . 
I 'm terribly embarrassed . 
- He and this new girlfriend ... ... made a killing at the track . 
Worse yet , I know her husband . 
A steal at only $450 . 
Now , I know it 's just as much my fault as it is yours . 
It was terrible . 
I accused her of molesting Tweety . 
Ain 't it a shame ? 
I know you feel guilty about our having to buy that door . 
Stop them Stop them , halt them , stop them 
I had a bit of trouble in the kitchen . 
- What 's wrong with a fifth wheel ? 
But no rash acts , no temper , and above all , no : 
- They worry about accidents . 
Selfish ! 
- Darrin , it was all my fault . 
- Wrong . 
Nobody 's gonna hurt you . 
What 's the trouble ? 
She never won a race on her own in her life . 
She came up lame this morning . 
And I have a feeling you 're gonna hate every word of it . 
The Tate 's kitchen must be a disaster area by now . 
Oh , stop being so suspicious . 
- I 'm warning you , Dave , knock it off ! 
- He called me a liar . 
He 's a troubled child if you know what I mean . 
You 're dead wrong . 
No , no , of course not . 
That was a mean , low , sneaky , underhanded trick . 
That 's what caused all the trouble . 
And you were wrong . 
- Oh , no , no . 
Don 't worry about it . 
No , no . 
Oh , don 't worry . 
But it 's only overnight , I didn 't expect any trouble . 
He 's been having trouble with them . 
It upsets my stomach worse than her cooking . 
No , no . 
It 's very dull . 
- Problem ? 
It 's a rash he gets . 
You cured his rash ? 
There 's something wrong . 
If you hurt her feelings I 'll never forgive you . 
Besides , I don 't figure you to be one of them evil witches . 
Broken ends . 
Oh , I wouldn 't worry about that if I were you . 
Do your worst . 
It 's the witch , of course ! 
- After she 's killed me . 
Oh , don 't be so upset , Samantha . 
Darrin will be furious . 
Isn 't that terrible ? 
You sound disappointed . 
I just resent your trying to blame this poor , innocent animal . 
Imagine her trying to put the blame on a poor dog like you . 
- You 're a witch ! 
- Don 't worry . 
What a terrible thing to say ! 
The trouble is , he 's been married for 16 . 
Mrs. Stephens , it was an accident . 
Don 't worry about it . 
No , no . 
- Poison ? 
There 's a city ordinance against poisoning people . 
Now , don 't worry , Aunt Clara said I could only get it once . 
Don 't worry . 
You 're just as bad as they are . 
Oh , is that bad ? 
That fire hydrant 's liable to get homesick any minute . 
Miserable . 
Oh , my poor Darrin . 
Darrin will freeze to death if I don 't get some clothes on him . 
Lousy ? 
I 've had a terrible day . 
My knowledge of the Civil War is slightly less than limited . 
The American Civil War . 
That bad , huh ? 
Not bad at all . 
And when I stop thinking , they disappear . 
You know , I 've been yelling at the wrong person . 
He had to leave town , and I got lonely . 
What 's wrong with that ? 
I 'm just disappointed . 
Problems . 
- Oh , no , no . 
Must be crying on each other 's shoulders . 
- He must be in some kind of trouble . 
Being sick . 
He also has a bad knee . 
You have a wicked slam , senator . 
Believe me , I don 't feel bad . 
She practically called you a loser . 
I 'll never trust you again . 
It 's very dirty up there , see ? 
Very bad , you know . 
- As usual , she 's out to destroy me . 
Forced landing . 
Don 't worry . 
No , of course not , dear . 
Haven 't we had enough trouble ? 
- That lousy bolt 's frozen . 
He really wanted to come , but he got sick . 
Don 't you worry , Mr. Franklin . 
You mean , you have a bad public image ? 
- Naturally , you were outraged . 
Maybe it has a broken leg . 
But now we 're in a terrible spot . 
Speaking of ill winds ! 
So dull . 
- You 're sick . 
You had to get that crazy idea Madame Marushka was a fake . 
No , no , don 't try to talk . 
- Steal the idea ? 
No more bloody marys at breakfast either . 
A little fast teamwork , and we avoided an accident . 
You really are outrageous . 
Wouldn 't hurt a fly . 
Now that 's what I call dirty pool . 
Just seems to me I 've heard that scream before . 
Unfortunate . 
You 're gonna carry this charade out to the bitter end , eh ? 
It 's not so funny to me . 
Tate , this is another example of one of your feeble -- Feeble -- 
Well , I know that , but a curse is a curse . 
Oh , no , no , sire . 
So the snivelling coward backed out of the duel ? 
Mother , Darrin is very upset . 
Ghost- to- ghost . 
- I 'm really terribly sorry , Sam . 
That 's just a family weakness . 
Oh , now , Louise , don 't worry . 
- Don 't worry about Larry . 
Besides , Mr. Stephens isn 't half bad . 
Nonsense , Phyilis . 
Haven 't we got enough problems ? 
If there 's one thing we don 't need , it 's another witch ! 
He made you cry . 
What a shame . 
And lose my professional standing ? 
No , the poor dear 's working . 
Maybe the words were wrong . 
No trouble . 
No , I 've forgotten him completely . 
Oh , I don 't hate it . 
A woman who is disappointed in married life . 
Sam and I had one of the worst fights we ever had . 
They 're anti- witch ! 
Where did I go wrong ? 
How dare you insult my accent , you upstart ! 
And mark you , soon he 'll be the rage in New York . 
It might get them in trouble with their own wives . 
- Oh , Mother , you 're such a sore loser . 
Now , don 't worry . 
Battle fatigue , I guess . 
This concludes the case for the prosecution . 
Just call me if you have a problem . 
I 'm starved . 
Because Darrin would never do anything to hurt me . 
The blind leading the blind . 
This evening was a fiasco . 
Take your mind off dumb- dumb . 
- You were wrong . 
I 'm being attacked . 
That 's what worries me . 
Why , it 's terrible . 
It 's in bad taste . 
Witchcraft got you into this mess . 
No woman would ever say no to you . 
Enemies ? 
And we 're very stubborn . 
You got it all wrong , Roy . 
Mr. Tate , I started out life as a poor boy . 
Don 't they know they 're poor ? 
Him and his childish tantrums . 
She might do something even worse . 
I 'm terribly sorry , but I 'm afraid I 'll have to leave . 
He hates to hurt anybody 's feelings . 
- Oh , that 's a darn shame . 
Clara , you will live to regret this moment . 
I 'll do anything you ask to make up for my poor behaviour . 
Oh , poor Mrs. Kravitz . 
Don 't worry about getting together with my father . 
- Oh , you poor thing . 
I still think you 're wrong , honey . 
She wore all the wrong clothes , said all the wrong things . 
I 'm starving . 
- I hate -- - Blast off . 
I know it 's painful for you to give up your command ... 
It wouldn 't hurt you . 
But you know , I kind of miss her whining . 
But I know you 're wrong . 
Not knowing you hasn 't hurt his golf game any . 
Tell you the truth , I 'm not sure I love her . 
This may sound kind of crazy ... 
That bad , huh ? 
And you have every right to cry foul . 
That is a problem . 
But you took a terrible risk . 
And don 't you worry about Larry . 
- It 'll hurt her feelings . 
Hey , Abner , you devil , you . 
You 're hopeless . 
Mr. Kravitz , aren 't you jealous ? 
Wrong . 
Right up till the time they become problems . 
He 'll say I 'm wasting water . 
- Nothing wrong with the first . 
You know the trouble with Joe ? 
I have never been so disgraced in all my life . 
Don 't worry , Tommy . 
- I 'd hate to tell you how many . 
- That 's a shame . 
Look , will you stop exaggerating . 
- ... and make a fool of myself ? 
From the normal to the mentally insane . 
- Oh , he can fake that , all right . 
Darrin , you don 't have any problem , believe me . 
But I really don 't think you have a problem . 
Other men don 't think I 'm so bad to look at . 
- Dull ? 
I 'm the one with the problem , Dr. Bombay . 
I 've been lying down too much . 
Darrin , you don 't know how you 've hurt Aunt Clara . 
Nothing to worry about . 
- So slight it 's too horrible to mention . 
Aunt Clara , Darrin may lose his job . 
I was just trying to throw a little scare into him . 
I 've been so worried about that poor Mrs. Tate . 
Well , I am the dumb witch . 
No , I 'm not pretty . 
I 've been completely wrong about McTavish . 
It wouldn 't hurt to dicker a little . 
Don 't worry about it , Mom . 
And I 'm not saying that because I 'm prejudiced . 
Well , I 'd suggest an earthquake , but I doubt if it would work . 
No , no . 
What a shame . 
As I say , what a shame . 
That Serena came down with a fearful headache . 
You 're saying that because you 're angry . 
- You 're fired . 
- Her mother 's a bad witch . 
Worry , worry . 
Oh , I have the same trouble . 
She probably woke up and started to cry . 
What kills me is I voted for them in the last election . 
That 's not very nice ! 
Not bad , eh ? 
In what way am I a problem ? 
Oh , the burdens of a mother with an ungrateful child . 
Or maybe she knows what 's wrong . 
She 's ill . 
Mommy , Daddy , is something wrong ? 
If you think I 'm unhappy , I am . 
I hate to be terse , but it 's getting worse . 
You 'd be bored to tears . 
My house is a wreck . 
- She could have been in an accident . 
He insulted me . 
Use Adrienne Sebastian products , or be ugly . 
Now , what 's wrong with the world today ? 
I fired him . 
I don 't believe you really fired him . 
No , no . 
Oh , you poor thing . 
Mrs. Stephens , you have flunked this interview . 
But don 't you worry about a thing , Mrs. Stephens . 
Is this one of those things that 's called a problem ? 
It 's rude . 
It 's about the Civil War . 
The marriage is in danger , Abner . 
It looked worse yesterday . 
Your mother , the wicked witch , has spoiled my appetite . 
If this were I 'd choke . 
No , I think it 's worse . 
Samantha would never forgive me if I left Tabitha alone . 
Because I 'm terrified to . 
Nothing personal , but I 'm allergic to you . 
I 'm starved . 
Darrin , what the devil are you doing ? 
Vain . 
- I feel terrible . 
I predict total disaster . 
I am wrong for the part of Napoleon ? 
- Selfish . 
Poor baby . 
It was lousy , which proves it was your imagination . 
How stupid of me to forget . 
I know how upsetting it is to misplace a husband . 
You said you were starved . 
Sam 's not kissing any mortal unless it 's me . 
So helpless . 
I 'd hate her to see you set such a poor example . 
Johann , you 're a sick man . 
No , you just forced us to discourage you . 
And if I say no , it 's no . 
- It 's outrageous . 
No , no , I can fix it myself . 
Look mad . 
Not bad , Sammy . 
I 'm crushed , destroyed . 
Excuse me for not getting up , but my feet are killing me . 
Uncle Arthur , it 's not funny ! 
Do something with him , something terrible ! 
No , no . 
You name it , and it 's wrong . 
- Not badly . 
- It 's a fatal case . 
Tabitha , did you do a no- no to this bird ? 
- Did I do something bad ? 
Not a bad start for my first day as a man . 
Where did I go wrong ? 
Who does he think he is , calling me a dumb- dumb ? 
Why so glum ? 
Calories will kill my figure . 
Who 's aching ? 
That 's liar 's blackmail . 
You call that constructive criticism ? 
- Oh , well , he 'll be devastated too . 
Abigail , don 't live dangerously . 
Abner , there 's a jackass in the Stephens ' living room ! 
- Don 't worry about a thing . 
The jackass and I are both trying too hard . 
Mutual concentration on a common problem will make us as one . 
Well , you 're wasting your depression , Mother dear . 
But don 't panic , not until I try an emergency incantation . 
Make him go away , but don 't offend him . 
- Especially a witch doctor . 
Not bad ? 
It 's a shame to waste an imagination like yours . 
But he 'll be furious ! 
I 'd be worried sick about you . 
She 's expressing her emotions of rivalry by refusing to eat . 
Oh , I 'm sorry if I disturbed your stupor . 
You think she dislikes you , but you 're wrong . 
But that terrible old Sidney just made me mad . 
So do as I tell you , or you 're fired . 
- Is something disturbing you , Dustbin ? 
Want to hear me cry louder than Adam ? 
That can be very irritating . 
Phyilis , I don 't know why you 're so upset . 
It 's my family 's fault , and I 'll handle it . 
Oh , she 's terribly depressed . 
Bit of a loser , in fact . 
- He didn 't mean to be rude . 
You dialled the wrong number . 
And it 's a shame you can 't stay . 
- Oh , what a shame . 
- I 've never had it so bad . 
You do look tired . 
- For a mortal , you have very few faults . 
These kids could scare a tribe of head- hunters . 
Not bad , Sammy . 
That could be very difficult to explain in mixed company . 
Don 't worry . 
The worst part is I never know what I 'm going to get . 
- It was a accident , Mommy . 
- Starved . 
I have many enemies , you know . 
No trouble at all . 
We have a problem , all right . 
I don 't see how that would hurt . 
You look more disappointed than I feel . 
Darrin , this is not for fun and games . 
And I 'm so furious , I 'm going to punish the both of you . 
That is unfair , unreasonable and downright despicable . 
That was a dirty trick ! 
Stop worrying . 
Anything wrong with being contagious ? 
You must think it 's terrible of me barging in this way . 
He 's been called worse than that . 
No , no , it 's not that . 
Now I 'm public enemy number one with Larry and Harrison . 
Why are you trying to humiliate me ? 
I 'll bet she 's furious . 
Because the lyric cries for a male vocalist or a male group . 
Against Boyce and Hart for rejecting her offer ? 
Rotten 's the word . 
It 's too bad you didn 't see that fight last night , Tate . 
You 're so uptight , Larry . 
Why not celebrate the sinking of the Titanic ? 
Forty- five isn 't bad . 
- No , not brilliant . 
If you 're going to be crowned Queen of England , it 's a steal . 
It 's fairly starving , I am . 
Don 't you know it is the worst of luck to harm a leprechaun ? 
All right , you useless little blabbermouth !

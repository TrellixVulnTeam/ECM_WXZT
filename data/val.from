Me , nasty ? 
Killjoy ! 
I don 't know why you 're so uptight . 
And in the meantime , I wouldn 't worry about it if I were you . 
I 've had a terrible day . 
And I have a feeling you 're gonna hate every word of it . 
The Tate 's kitchen must be a disaster area by now . 
Oh , stop being so suspicious . 
- I 'm warning you , Dave , knock it off ! 
It upsets my stomach worse than her cooking . 
No , no . 
It 's very dull . 
I 'll send a note of regret this afternoon . 
And don 't worry , Gideon has everything under control . 
- You are in trouble , aren 't you ? 
I 'm terribly concerned about Mr. Stephens . 
Oh , no , no , not at all . 
Oh , I am sorry , but accidents will happen . 
He had to leave town , and I got lonely . 
Stop them Stop them , halt them , stop them 
I had a bit of trouble in the kitchen . 
- What 's wrong with a fifth wheel ? 
But no rash acts , no temper , and above all , no : 
Darrin , you 're not exactly leaving your problems at the office . 
Isn 't that a bit unethical ? 
No use being upset about it , because that 's the way I feel . 
- You 're a witch ! 
- Don 't worry . 
What a terrible thing to say ! 
I wouldn 't send my worst enemy on a trip with Louise . 
Poor chap had a nervous breakdown , we were only halfway there . 
- Is Samantha reaIly unhappy ? 
You 're dead wrong . 
You know , I 've been yelling at the wrong person . 
- Oh , no , no . 
Don 't worry about it . 
No , no . 
Oh , don 't worry . 
But it 's only overnight , I didn 't expect any trouble . 
He 's been having trouble with them . 
You 're dead wrong . 
No , no , of course not . 
That was a mean , low , sneaky , underhanded trick . 
That 's what caused all the trouble . 
And you were wrong . 
- He called me a liar . 
He 's a troubled child if you know what I mean . 
And I have a feeling you 're gonna hate every word of it . 
The Tate 's kitchen must be a disaster area by now . 
Oh , stop being so suspicious . 
- I 'm warning you , Dave , knock it off ! 
It upsets my stomach worse than her cooking . 
No , no . 
It 's very dull . 
Lousy ? 
It 's a rash he gets . 
You cured his rash ? 
There 's something wrong . 
If you hurt her feelings I 'll never forgive you . 
I 'm just disappointed . 
Problems . 
What 's wrong with that ? 
He had to leave town , and I got lonely . 
Nobody 's gonna hurt you . 
What 's the trouble ? 
She never won a race on her own in her life . 
She came up lame this morning . 
- He must be in some kind of trouble . 
- Oh , no , no . 
Must be crying on each other 's shoulders . 
I 've had a terrible day . 
- Problem ? 
Besides , I don 't figure you to be one of them evil witches . 
Broken ends . 
Oh , I wouldn 't worry about that if I were you . 
Do your worst . 
It 's the witch , of course ! 
- After she 's killed me . 
Oh , don 't be so upset , Samantha . 
Darrin will be furious . 
Isn 't that terrible ? 
You sound disappointed . 
I just resent your trying to blame this poor , innocent animal . 
Imagine her trying to put the blame on a poor dog like you . 
- You 're a witch ! 
- Don 't worry . 
What a terrible thing to say ! 
The trouble is , he 's been married for 16 . 
Mrs. Stephens , it was an accident . 
Don 't worry about it . 
No , no . 
- Poison ? 
There 's a city ordinance against poisoning people . 
Now , don 't worry , Aunt Clara said I could only get it once . 
Don 't worry . 
You 're just as bad as they are . 
Oh , is that bad ? 
That fire hydrant 's liable to get homesick any minute . 
Miserable . 
Oh , my poor Darrin . 
Darrin will freeze to death if I don 't get some clothes on him . 
My knowledge of the Civil War is slightly less than limited . 
The American Civil War . 
That bad , huh ? 
Not bad at all . 
And when I stop thinking , they disappear . 
He 'll get really angry . 
Stupid ! 
Damn it ! 
Officer , don 't give me a bad reputation . 
If I take more , I 'm gonna die . 
You 're a killer . 
And sing , " Even If I die , " 
How about going plumb to hell ? 
Now , what makes people so jittery about the dead ? 
He 's just trying to cheat the rope . 
Why did you commit this murder ? 
No , I 'm not interested in buying anything . 
I kill to live , to eat . 
I 'll see it all till the day I die . 
Maybe you want for me to kill him . 
[ GUN CLlCKS EMPTY ] 
It 's only because I thought he 'd surely have to kill us both . 
Who you think pardon my sin when I do the bad thing ? 
- Poor white trash ? 
Well , I 've never been so insulted in all my life . 
Where the hell is that dagger the man was killed with ?

Who you think pardon my sin when I do the bad thing ? 
- Poor white trash ? 
Well , I 've never been so insulted in all my life . 
Where the hell is that dagger the man was killed with ? 
The war was ... 
I don 't really blame him , do you ? 
He 's sick of coconuts . 
- Is it painful ? 
Now this is going to hurt a little . 
- No , no . 
- I don 't think badly of you either . 
Because you 've been talking total nonsense as usual . 
In the war , everybody loses something . 
I wanted them to be furious - and they were . 
Never fear experiments ! 
Manon is my first and last sin . 
- That only makes it worse . 
Good grief , he died in 40 BC ! 
I 'll scream ! 
Thinking about Fathers Day terrifies me . 
" Never has disgusted . 
It 's wrong . 
No , no . 
Thinking about Fathers Day terrifies me . 
" Never has disgusted .

No , no . 
I wasn 't ill . 
And that means something , does it , Mrs Savage ? 
- Could I have a word with you , Mrs Savage ? 
He suffers from ill health . 
He sometimes uses it when he gets an attack 
Is Mrs Savage holding her usual meeting this afternoon ? 
- Die ? 
Nobody 's dead . 
She 's over- tired , I think .

You think you can kill me ? 
Death before dishonor , is that it ? 
lf they find out , they 'll kill you . 
No , no . 
You must be mad . 
I 'm very sorry to trouble you , sir . 
You 'll hurt yourself . 
Your poor servant ever . 
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark . 
I am but mad north- north- west . 
If thou wilt needs marry , marry a fool . 
And do still , by these pickers and stealers . 
Thou wretched , rash , intruding fool , farewell ! 
I 'll bestow him , and will answer well The death I gave him . 
Thus bad begins , and worse remains behind . 
How came he dead ? 
I must commune with your grief , Or you deny me right . 
Her death was doubtful . 
- O , he is mad , Laertes . 
How I am punished With sore distraction . 
Whose motive , in this case , should stir me most to my revenge . 
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire . 
War and understanding seldom mix . 
I have two men dead and one wounded . 
I 'm tired . 
The war seems to make everything right . 
Sergeant War . 
The cruel god is vain . 
Tonight , it 's a problem . 
All that singing gives me a pain . 
You are sad . 
He 's not rich . 
This is a disaster . 
Mother , can 't you see how unhappy I am ? 
I 'il meet death before you do .

I get tired , too . 
N. Fokin at the sick Nekrasov 's bedside . 
You didn 't rob or kill anyone . 
Am I condemned or what , really ? 
You 're acting foolishly , Kolia . 
Valya , don 't be angry .

The 350th day of war . 
Very scary . 
To hell with the etiquette . 
You 're wrong . 
What are your thoughts about this problem ? 
I suppose it 's because I 'm not strong enough . 
Not to mention the recent bad harvests . 
- You want us to kill Asahina ? 
You 'll be mine if I slay this man you want killed ? 
No , no ! 
- The poison in his tea worked , and his body is paralyzed . 
Don 't struggle or you 'll make a mess ! 
I must have my revenge upon him ! 
Kyoshiro will then die , while you look on . 
- Old man , if this is a setup , our enemy is risking a lot . 
I believe you have him in prison somewhere . 
- Fools ! 
I hate that word " down . " 
You got a danger sign on you big as a house ! 
You gonna stop that crying ? 
We 'll go down to hell and back if you like . 
I 'd call it the " Reign of Terror . "

I hate this place ! 
Damn you , Molly Brown ! 
I don 't think that 's wrong . 
I hate you ... 
It makes me bitter ! 
Do you hate me that much ? 
I had my reasons for coming , but now I 'm in serious trouble . 
I 'm so mad ! 
I 'm going to die . 
You really fooled me , didn 't you ? 
I 'd rather die than marry him . 
If it comes to the worst , I 'll kill him ! 
And I explained the farce of Mitsuko 's pregnancy , too . 
Now , tell me if you regret what you 've gone and done . 
I 'll ruin you ! 
It 's suicide and to come right over . 
It makes me so angry ! 
It was weak of me . 
If she really did , she wouldn 't be so cruel . 
Let 's die .

I 'm grumbling because I 'm tired .

I entered the belly of the enemy for the very first time . 
For a month we have been digging blind between tunnel 20 and 22 . 
- Hey , am I disturbing ? 
" And then he told her , steal an umbrella ... " 
So , my crazy man , you wanted to leave ? 
- Come on , no one ever dies of hunger in Milan . 
No killing , no authority ! 
Xia Jie was brutal and Tang overturned it 
There 're different meanings to die 
I 'll make him ruin his country with shame 
Anger will be everywhere . 
What 's that for wasting so much things ? 
Don 't kill me . 
Kill the son and cook his flesh 
Stab forward ! 
Bulgarian soldiers have seen worse than that ! 
They 're dead tired . 
It 's useless . 
I 'm afraid we 'll loose this war too . 
They 're ugly . 
Its forbidden . 
No , you misunderstood me . 
Of course , we shan 't starve . 
Has the question upset you , is it such an awkward question ? 
You can 't say it to some people as they 'll be miserable . 
Useless ! 
Can I just listen to my brother 's cowardly lectures ? ! 
It looks bad to see this Dojo gloomy like a graveyard ! 
This is a problem . 
Get rid of your troubles there . 
From your enemy ? 
So I thought of you with concern , as rude as it may seem . 
We are here to kill ... ! 
Unless we defeat Musashi , we cannot continue on ! 
It 's useless . 
Shoot .. shoot ! 
I know that we risk nothing , on the sweet land of France ... 
Don’ t waste your time , he only speaks Turkish .. 
They 've murdered my husband ! 
Answer the door .. dumb bell .. 
Only as revenge against the terrorist 
It 's very bad ... 
Pay him , but don 't lose them ! 
Don 't shoot ! 
But was it his fault or the fact that he lived in Portugal ? 
- Do you have any health problems ? 
We 're the ones who destroy it . 
Don 't be cruel ! 
Could you sit still ... ... if somebody killed your father ... 
In this case , you 're an ant going to war with an elephant . 
It 's that Yakichi bastard ! 
Besides ... this is horrible for the girl ! 
If the constable sees you , all hell will break loose . 
If I 'm broke , I make money by gambling . 
Now all the Shogun 's eligible heirs are dead . 
It 's too dangerous ! 
Die ! 
Had I been defeated ... ... then you 'd have slain Takayuki . 
Could you sit still ... ... if somebody killed your father ... 
In this case , you 're an ant going to war with an elephant . 
It 's that Yakichi bastard ! 
Besides ... this is horrible for the girl !

There 's no reason why you should die before your time . 
If i 'm broke , i make money by gambling . 
NoW all the Shogun 's eligible heirs are dead . 
It 's too dangerous ! 
Die ! 
Had i been defeated ... ... then you 'd have slain Takayuki . 
There 's no shame to admit your suffering . 
They gonna kill you . 
One day she wrote me a letter in panic . 
We have to find the intruder , and destroy him . 
Poor Ciccio ! 
Poor Ciccio . 
- Shit ... 
Heart failure . 
There must be a leak ! 
Is your father very angry ? 
I 'm terrible at relationships . 
I never know why he gets so angry . 
How annoying it is , your generation ! 
Don 't make me insist over something so ridiculous . 
Cirilla , what is I lose Peppino over this ? 
Almost as if a spell has been broken . 
I was ill , problems with my nerves ...

Beejgupt never loved himself . 
She is lying . 
- Any problem ? 
" - You 've come to discover sin ? 
I drink everyday but I don 't regret it . 
You don 't worry about removing this thorn 
Your eyes are blindfolded by temptation and greed 
- Life is a dream - Then murder committed in dream is no murder ! 
The body you cleause with saffron and musk will be destroyed 
" That is why , these strewn pearls told me she had wept . " 
This body will be destroyed 
If you cry , how will I feel ? " 
" No , sire No . " 
This sinning body destroyed my years of penance ! 
- Bad series . 
The war cross with palms . 
And your brothers want to kill you for peace’ s sake ? 
Dangerous for England ? 
Did I betray my identity ? 
They’ re the souls of all the dead people from Hiroshima . 
No , I feel dirty . 
They’ il try to kill me anyway , you know , so ... 
He must be arrested ! 
But useless . 
My husband died . 
Only cowards cry 
You can only go ahead by going through these problems 
You starve while I eat , that cant happen 
Doctor says I am very sick 
There is no pain in singing . 
Mother told him but he said you were hurt and you needed medicine 
See you fool . 
L must go - Tell me what 's wrong 
But I 'm not happy with your numbers 
Are you crying ? 
Even while he was ill , he didn 't forget to pay your fees 
That day I was lying to you 
Faster , you dumb ox . 
And so will be mine , mad the whole world has gone . 
Me and a thief ? ! 
One ass is enough . 
Fight ! 
Fight ! 
I was wrong . 
We shouldn 't have killed so many . 
There are plenty of dead men , just make up a story . 
If they released the monies , we wouldn 't have this problem . 
They 're taking all the food , you coward ! 
I made complaints to point at the inequities . 
- You dumb- ass ! 
What the fuck . 
In this room there 's only one liar . 
This loony is totally brain- dead . 
How could Krister invite such an idiot ? 
Nothing of this is dirty . 
I dumped him . 
That bloody guy . 
Don 't worry , Krister . 
No need to worry . 
Don 't worry about anything . 
So you can lose the attitude . 
And you weren’ t wrong . 
He dumped me . 
A bastard , a coward , a pimp . 
Coward ! 
Just the thought of the anguish to which she 'd be subjected ... 
No doubt about it , sir ! 
Helpless before a girl ! 
How dare you deceive me ... and put me through this ? 
You fool ! 
Let 's send someone after him to kill him on the road . 
One dangerous predicament after another ... 
Not knowing if I would live or die . 
What a lunatic , mad woman ... 
That woman 's gone insane ! 
So this is your smuggling ship . 
- Prisoner ? 
I may faIl . 
And when is this most melancholy of topics most poetical ? 
No , I 've stayed alone . 
I 'd rather die ! 
You 're dead ! 
I 've never loved anyone as much as you . 
He soon found every cause to recall with regret his Kyoto days . 
How I loathed myself for divorcing you ! 
It 's wrong to allow yourself to suffer on my account . 
It was because of poverty . 
Why should I think ill of you ? 
Then , the eyes of the horrible woman 
I would kill you this moment ! 
Your girl must be blind too . 
Then , it was the spirit of the dead that came here ?

- What" s wrong , Rock ? 
Taken at Cromer Sands on a dull August afternoon . 
- Perhaps I 'm wrong . 
But what possible reason would my sister have for lying ? 
But once he was dead , apparently he never shut up . 
If you don 't eat , you 'll just collapse .

Let 's hear about the deal with the rape . 
What 's wrong with you ? 
You mean , your gal was the only one that died ?

He said he was a confirmed pick pocket and thief .

But I feel bad for Mom . 
Doctor says she has breast cancer . 
Don 't die ! 
Don 't be rash and hold on a little while longer . 
Don 't be rash and hold on a little while longer .

- Only if you panic ! 
It is not for me to say if another man is a coward . 
Even death ? 
- This weakness I overlook . 
Wrong . 
Now ... ... what do you fear most ? 
What fear could turn you into a coward ?

To crash into the sun . 
I figured I 'd be dead before it happened . 
We 're on a collision course with the sun ! 
' This is disastrous . 
You 're near danger zone . ' 
If anyone can find the fault , they can . 
I 'll look at the problem . 
We haven 't time to argue , Nosey , er ... 
( Car horn and crash ) 
Three minutes ... we 've failed ! 
- The danger 's over , now . 
Now all we need is an accident . 
The radioactivity will do untold damage . ' 
Cut a large panel , then stop . ' 
- Tin Tin , prepare the sick room . 
They are a menace . 
I 'm near the danger zone . 
Abandon area ! 
You can 't leave us to die ! 
Those people are a menace ! 
Before it was even known a man was trapped , 
I guess we 're ALL outraged by those ... those RATS . 
Worse . 
You knew those murderers would try to kill you . 
' I believe the ship is in no danger . ' 
We could fail on a job for the first time . 
It 's terrifying to realise how much we depend on communication . 
I 've found her - drifting towards the danger zone . 
Terrifying ! 
( Bomb ticks ) 
Detonate the bomb . 
Leaving danger zone . 
I 'm tired of standing dead still . 
' we 'll all receive fatal exposure . ' 
Destroyed , Mr Dandridge ? 
Tell them the automatic signals are broken . 
And I mean trouble . 
The whole section - it 'll collapse any minute ! 
Are they trying to murder us or something ? ! 
That 's where you 're wrong , Tracy . 
Don 't worry . 
This is terrible ! 
They 're trapped ! 
We 'll look into it , but first we must destroy that film . 
What has become of that incompetent fool ? ! 
We were wrong . 
# That dangerous ... 
Parker , press the alarm bell ! 
When I say , fire the magnetic grabs ! 
I figured I 'd be dead before it happened . 
I 'll call if we have any problems . ' 
' There 's no chance of any danger . ' 
It looks bad . 
Base , I 'm at the danger zone , about to drop the pod . 
Are you really angry , Jeff ? 
- Dad can 't have been that angry . 
' Seascape 's in trouble , Scott . 
We 're trapped . 
Will hover in the danger zone . 
Alas , señor , we have no menu . 
He could answer all Scott 's danger- zone queries . 
You will suffer no after- effects with this beam . 
- Penelope 's in trouble . 
Don 't worry , no one is going to stop us now . 
If you 're so worried , get back in the rear . 
( Crash of thunder ) 
Don 't worry - I know what I 'm doing . 
Now we can get to the trouble spots . 
- No- one 's arguing , sir . 
Loman 's trapped , and the door 's jammed ... 
Killed , boys ? 
( Alan ) 'In his panic , he started one of the tapes . ' 
- You stupid ... 
- 'There 's been a power failure . ' 
With you , I have so far failed , Professor , 
Take off from danger zone delayed . 
I guess I worry too much . 
When the entire project is abandoned , this casket will be yours . 
Approaching danger zone . 
- There 's no time to lose . 
' You fool ! 
' We 've wasted enough time . ' 
Nothing 's going to go wrong . 
' We are going to prove them wrong . 
No one can stop us , least of all you ! 
Thunderbird 2 from Thunderbird 1 , approaching danger zone . 
Death is a constant companion . 
But this time ... this time you will fail ! 
Don 't worry . 
- Approaching the danger zone . 
The temple is in ruins , Scott . 
If we fail , we 've had it . 
( Lester ) There are severe tremors near the cutting . 
If they don 't hurry , they 'll have a wasted trip . 
- In Russia , at an oil rig fire . 
- 'They 're trapped on an inspection platform . ' 
You put everyone in danger when you act selfishly . 
Dad , you 've done a greatjob since Mom died . 
Assumed dead when his illegal diamond mine collapsed in Malaya . 
Brains , we 're going into the accident zone . 
Nowadays , trying without some good backing is futile 
I know and understand everything , but I am helpless . 
And it leads to all the chaos 
There 's a problem , it 's Sunday tomorrow . 
Am I wrong , Mr. Roy ? 
I used to hate whisky . 
My wife will be hurt . 
Don 't worry I will return it to you tomorrow . 
I was a coward then . 
There 's a problem , it 's Sunday tomorrow . 
Am I wrong , Mr. Roy ? 
I used to hate whisky . 
My wife will be hurt . 
You don 't need time but you lack something else ... 
Don 't worry I will return it to you tomorrow . 
I was a coward then . 
- Prisoner of war ? 
War . 
You have got to be taught what is right and ... what is wrong . 
Oh , this is ridiculous ! 
It 's absolute madness to try this shot , Hunter . 
The fire brigade 's here ! 
They broke all our bottles . 
No need for any of you to worry about your physical condition . 
Negative . 
All the rest of you would be one big , raging mass of virus . 
No , no sign of him yet . 
- Is she violent ? 
But Smith the victim , he 's in a state of shock . 
You 'll never have cause to regret this , believe me . 
We 're in imminent danger . 
It 's not doing us any harm . 
Again , I suggest you destroy this thing immediately . 
It seems that two more unexpected problems have dropped in on us . 
I don 't think we have anything to worry about . 
No , no , no , no , no . 
- If there 's any indication of danger , we 'll shoot . 
Don 't be frightened . 
Don 't be frightened . 
- If you 'll excuse me -- - No , no , no . 
You 're a troublemaker . 
It doesn 't look broken at all . 
Nonsense and jabberwocky . 
- Oh , don 't worry . 
Maybe she should lose her turn a couple of times . 
He wasn 't being destructive . 
If you 're tired , I can carry you piggyback . 
The wreck of a space vehicle . 
I 'm going to go in and check our other weapons . 
All our weapons are gone . 
- Dr. Smith , that 's utter nonsense . 
- Is Judy in danger ? 
- Audible evidence : negative . 
The freezing tube broke when the capsule crashed . 
- That dirty -- 
Don 't worry about him . 
Don 't worry . 
- Choking ... can 't speak . 
- Keep firing ! 
- Something wrong ? 
- Something wrong ? 
Get me out of this dreadful contraption . 
There 's no need to bother . 
But have no fear , the creature cannot escape . 
Let us look at animals which live less violently . 
- I am sort of tired . 
Immediate danger has passed . 
But your animals -- they 'll kill me ! 
I know I shall be forced to try that method of locomotion . 
Is this fear I detect ? 
Have you ever seen a more dangerous animal ? 
Have you given a lot to the poor , Mr. Tucker ? 
And when I find this downright dirt- poor feller ... 
Argh , no , no . 
- we won 't kill no one . 
Waste not , want not . 
Till we starve to death ? 
I saw you in trouble over the scope , so I -- 
- We 're trapped ! 
- What 's wrong ? 
Doubters , such doubters . 
Computers inadequate for further information . 
- You 're asking for trouble . 
You will ruin everything ... with your unfriendly vibrations . 
Oh , no , no . 
- Are poltergeists dangerous ? 
Nonsense ! 
What 's wrong ? 
Nonsense . 
What 's wrong ? 
But I must 've done something wrong . 
I wouldn 't say you were cheated out of it . 
If necessary , I will destroy him . 
I 've got troubles . 
Be ugly . 
Don 't worry about Penny . 
What are you so sad about ? 
Those globby things can 't hurt ya . 
You 'll ruin everything . 
We 're dealing with a savage . 
Why you conceited , dirty- faced little boy ! 
Dr. Smith , there 's no reason to alarm the children . 
You should be ashamed . 
That 's absolutely ridiculous , Major . 
I 've heard that tired old song before . 
There is always a margin of error , even in a machine . 
It was a very uncomfortable position . 
I was afraid you would be beaten . 
There is no disgrace in defeat . 
We 've been through worse things than this . 
The damage is already done . 
The pain . 
- Utterly ridiculous , of course . 
I 'm referring to our last conversation when you insulted me . 
I just can 't believe that he 'd do such a terrible thing . 
We may not like it , but we 're stuck with him . 
I just wanted to say that I regret deeply what has happened . 
I shall have no alternative but to destroy you . 
Oh , my feet are in agony . 
This is no time for nonsense , you ninny . 
And there are no grounds for violent action . 
We , uh , might do worse in selecting a king . 
The royal pain of it all . 
You are useless creature . 
Yeah , but you might get hurt if you stayed out here . 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
You 're hungry little devils , aren 't you ? 
Information received highly suspicious . 
- Something wrong ? 
I 'm too tired to hold you any longer . 
Penny , you gave me a terrible fright . 
No , no . 
And you disappoint me , sir . 
- There must be something wrong . 
There is something very wrong ! 
Danger ! 
Now I know why Don gets so mad at Dr. Smith . 
Danger ! 
Get out or we 'll all die . 
What 's wrong , son ? 
I meant no offense . 
Poor Dr. Smith . 
Must you disturb an old man 's rest with your horseplay ? 
- But not your intellectual equal . 
Oh , poor Dr. Smith . 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
Negative . 
All the rest of you would be one big , raging mass of virus . 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
Major , a dreadful calamity has befallen us . 
You were referring to " yesterday 's unfortunate accident . " 
We all have occasional outbursts of ill temper . 
No , I 'm sorry if I insulted you , Dr. Smith . 
There is no danger . 
You realize , of course , that we seem to be imprisoned here ? 
Oh , he can 't do any harm here . 
- It 's not exactly a tropical paradise , Penny . 
Probably dead . 
- Negative . 
Warning ! 
Too bad about young Will though . 
I could 've had the Robot kill you just now as you came in . 
- causes any more trouble . 
Nonsense . 
Bad terrain . 
Might have tried to destroy us all ? 
They 'll be killed if we don 't . 
To be stomped to death ? 
I saw you in trouble over the scope so I -- 
- What 's wrong ? 
You know , curiosity killed the cat one time , boy . 
You go on and cry . 
The heartbreak may be too much for them . 
- No , it 's too dangerous . 
Let Dr. Smith have his dirty old diamonds ! 
Don 't hurt anyone ! 
- Don 't trouble about me , my boy . 
- You can 't die ! 
You hurt me ! 
Never fear , my boy . 
I 'm on fire ! 
Why , your cousin has back trouble too . 
And the rest of the people you gotta cheat some other time . 
Wouldn 't it be dangerous for you to meet him ? 
You wanna ruin everything ? 
Well , that was no accident . 
- Suppose we lose ? 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
- You confess all 25 killings ? 
You 've made a science out of cold- blooded murder . 
He probably panicked and got himself lost . 
I must warn the others there is a dangerous alien among us . 
Will , don 't lag ! 
You make me sick . 
It 's Zeno , the space killer ! 
He 's the most bloodthirsty murderer in all space . 
Negative . 
- No , no ! 
I really have a very poor ear for music . 
Oh , the pain , the pain . 
You needn 't look so glum . 
I tell you we 're all in dire peril . 
You 're making the Robot very unhappy . 
- You mean you think you 're gonna cry ? 
From the moment I saw them , I computed they were evil . 
- It was horrible . 
Judy was nearly strangled by that hose on the compression unit . 
They are creatures of evil ambitions . 
My memory banks are weak on this point . 
He will be my guard against all dangers . 
You barbarous little devils . 
He doesn 't look as scary as he did the first time I saw him . 
No , it 's no use . 
Don , I feel as if I 've hurt you in some way . 
- We don 't mean you any harm , sir . 
- Don 't shoot ! 
Don 't shoot ! 
We don 't mean you any harm , sir . 
If the alien had really wanted to harm Penny and Dr. Smith ... 
We are living in a very dangerous galaxy , Dr. Smith . 
Beneath that bright facade is a miserable , frightened child . 
But without our assistance , Mr. Keema will be destroyed . 
We 'll both be destroyed ! 
- Oh , the poor Robot . 
I 'm sorry , but this is terribly important . 
They 're extremely dangerous . 
Prepare yourself for battle , Mr. Keema ! 
Oh , I 'm so ashamed . 
- A bomb ? 
Oh , my back is a disaster area . 
Danger ! 
Just thinking of her is a menace . 
I thought she was anything but sinister . 
I thought he was going to kill me . 
- When you angry , nose wiggle . 
I forced myself to overcome my fears . 
- He didn 't hurt me , Dr. Smith . 
You are not so smart . 
Punch , kick ... choke , break bone . 
When new one fight ... will kill old one . 
No , no . 
Don 't hurt me ! 
No need to worry . 
- Oh , never did mortal man suffer such a shaking . 
The poor boy . 
Nonsense . 
Nonsense . 
Something must have gone wrong . 
What 's so dreadful about that ? 
It 's very bad form to stare at people while they 're eating . 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
My orders are to destroy this machine immediately . 
Don 't hurt me ! 
Misery , misery . 
- The pain . - 
And what have I to fear , you nattering ninny ? 
Oh , sadness , oh , sorrow . 
What a foul weaver of cowardly conspiracy that fellow is . 
We 'll attend to the damage presently . 
Oh , real trouble is what we got , Robur . 
And don 't worry about Dr. Smith . 
Negative . 
Angry ? 
Oh , I 'm so ashamed of the dreadful things ... 
Poor little egg . 
And they frighten me ! 
[ Chokes , Coughs ] 
I am called a thief . 
We all want to go home as badly as you do . 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
" When in danger or in doubt , run in circles , yell and shout . " 
A major catastrophe . 
You have overcome your weakness for personal relationships . 
Nasty thing ! 
I sees a bad end for the lot of 'em . 
Never mind the lugubrious lecture , just analyze this for us ... 
Ya ain 't mad at me , are ya ? 
Eh , poor ol ' Deek . 
I shall never survive the strain of this dreadful box . 
I really do not mean you any harm . 
Instant Destroyer And Killer ? 
No , somebody 's been hurt . 
I am programmed to destroy Target Android 105 . 
That android destroyer could be here anytime . 
I 'm afraid that 's nonsense . 
You mean you talked him out of killing you ? 
Destroy ! 
- You deceived me . 
We have no time to lose . 
- John , what 's wrong ? 
- John , what 's wrong ? 
John , what 's wrong with these things ? 
They could wreck all our equipment with this . 
You have defeated me . 
- Something appears to be wrong . 
Something appears to be wrong . 
Danger ! 
That 's a nasty crack you took there . 
He 's just trying to make me feel guilty . 
Oh , the pain , the pain . 
It 's trying to kill me ! 
Inform that ridiculous contraption that I am not rusty ! 
I should not laugh . 
No , I doubt it . 
Destroy it ! 
What a horrible experience . 
Our Robot 's a complicated and dangerous piece of machinery . 
It 's struggling to keep functioning . 
- Now , let 's get on with this nonsense . 
- You mean they 'll die ? 
You risked the injury of everyone here . 
All wrong . 
- Silence , you cowardly weakling ! 
You wouldn 't harm me , would you ? 
- Negative . 
I do not believe they meant any harm . 
He fails badly . 
Dr. Smith , I 've got an awful lot of work to do . 
Negative , William Robinson . 
You oughta be ashamed of yourself . 
Destroy ! 
The Earth people are doomed . 
We are on our way to destroy the Robinsons . 
I am ashamed to bow and scrape before my enemies . 
- I 'll get more weapons . 
The little robots could attack at any moment now ! 
Oh , sorrow . 
Emergency ! 
Emergency ! 
- Are they hurt ? 
Now , don 't worry about me . 
Now , look at the mess you 've got me into ! 
And treasonous to the first word . 
I forgot that you 're not used to such terrible sights , huh ? 
Ruthven that sent me to the block ! 
Through your miserable carcass -- [ Exhales Deeply ] 
Once his miserable , worthless head rolls in the dust ... 
Lying there on the bottom of that lake for 900 years ... 
Ah , the poor laddie is daft . 
Out into the tempest and the storm and face the hostile Indians ! 
We are the you idiot ! 
Something 's wrong with him . 
If I attack the alien monster , he in turn will destroy Penny . 
- Yes , but the problem is who 's going to tell them ? 
Those old fools . 
What a way to die ! 
- You have destructive weapons ? 
- You have the weapons ? 
Watch what you 're doing , you clumsy dump ! 
My entire system has undergone a traumatic experience . 
For example , I am forbidden to go outside , where -- 
Let me worry about that . 
- More lies . 
Nonsense , you nervous ninny . 
Something 's wrong . 
But as you can see , I have other problems to consider . 
It must also be remembered , he is a dangerous Dr. Smith . 
It 's horrible . 
And don 't worry about me . 
And don 't worry about me . 
I 'm frustrated ! 
- " Never fear , Smith is here . " 
Don 't worry about that . 
No need for any of you to worry about your physical condition . 
- Dr. Smith is really worried , sir , and he 's all alone . 
I didn 't mean to get anyone in trouble . 
Fiendish punishment ? 
- [ Cries Out ] 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
Nonsense , my boy . 
Nonsense , my boy . 
What a shame . 
He might suffer a series of , uh , dizzy spells . 
Your dad wasn 't too badly hurt , and that 's what counts . 
- how about taking down that block and tackle ? 
It wouldn 't do any harm to enter Mr. Myko 's games ... 
Ah , there is the evil in being too civilized . 
You know what 'll happen if you lose . 
- It is futile to continue the contest . 
We 're going to check for damage , all of us . 
- Poor ? 
Miserably destitute . 
I haven 't all day to spend on this ridiculous planet ! 
Assistant Thief . 
No , no ! 
Oh , what a horrible way to go . 
Go on and do your dirty work . 
And don 't worry about Dr. Smith . 
He 's scared . 
Too bad . 
- His theory is useless . 
You may initiate attack procedures once again . 
Why should we worry about the humans ? 
- What 's wrong ? 
Even if we have to kill everyone to do it ? 
I think I 'm going to be ill . 
[ Crying ] 
Inasmuch as we shall all be dead before very long ... 
And I 'm sorry you had to destroy her . 
Oh , stop struggling , you silly fool . 
I 'm in a terrible hurry . 
- I think something 's wrong , sir . 
Oh , no , no , no , no ! 
For shame , Major . 
See the terrifying , raging major . 
will be very unhappy with you . 
There does seem to be some sports equipment lying around . 
Really horrible- looking creatures . 
Besides , only fools step in where angels fear to tread . 
I am not at liberty to reveal pilvig -- privelig -- 
His appetite has been very poor lately . 
Major , I 'm completely exhausted . 
Are you frightened , Will Robinson ? 
Well , as much as I hated to dig into the reserve food supply ... 
Don 't worry . 
You also had no reason to mess up our ship so we couldn 't leave . 
I shall be forced to defend myself . 
Boy , that would be awful . 
dead ? 
Careful with that cargo , you miserable misfits ! 
Don 't worry . 
Of course , you idiot . 
- No , no , I didn 't . 
- Of all the injustice . 
No , no , no , please ! 
- Cut that tape and you miss everything . 
They were always threatening to leave me somewhere . 
Smith , this machine threatened you ? 
The ship will be destroyed by an uncharted asteroid . 
- All hands to the fire extinguishers ! 
We 're gonna freak out together ! 
Not unjust that I should be condemned for another 's crime ? 
A prisoner has escaped . 
This isn 't the escaped prisoner . 
This is all your fault , Major . 
When I get my hands on prisoners , they stay that way . 
- You are a criminal type . 
I have ways of dealing with prisoners who think they are tough . 
I 'm a prison number . 
Prisoner 756498002 ... meet prisoners 756498273 and 756498274 . 
And if happens , I 'd hate to be you ... with you , old buddy ! 
No , no . 
Prisoners ' effects . 
You are wrong . 
It 's all your fault . 
Don 't worry about a thing . 
Oh , what a terrible experience . 
No rest for the wicked , you know . 
Do you think you can find and fix what 's wrong by then , Dad ? 
Dad , why would they want to attack us ? 
I 'm trapped here with a madman . 
I wouldn 't want to leave you here alone in this dangerous place . 
Cease and desist , or I will destroy . 
- Your father is also unacceptable ... 
A game that eventually will destroy this entire world . 
- No , no ! 
He could 've gone over to the enemy . 
Oh , I guess you can see what kind of trouble we 're in . 
We vegetables can be violent too if we have to . 
Don 't touch me , you ungrateful underling ! 
Oh , no , no , no . 
Died , my foot ! 
I 'm doomed . 
You are quite mistaken , you know . 
No jug , and almost no thou . 
Not to worry , sir . 
Boy , he looks in bad shape . 
No , no , no . 
Warning ! 
I shall die ! 
It 's me , you idiot ! 
Oh , sadness , oh , sorrow . 
It 's hurting me . 
Alas , poor Robinsons . 
I 'm completely exhausted . 
You cannot force me to do something I know is wrong . 
I know it hurts . 
I 'm just a poor , innocent victim of an alien society . 
Force level building to fatal intensity ! 
- Any damage ? 
" no " to the ridiculous suggestion that we land . 
A horrible demise on some ignominious planet . 
They 're going to kill me ! 
It 's hopeless . 
There are severe penalties for killing out of season . 
Getting there -- That 'll be the minor problem . 
If it is stilled , we will die . 
- Never fear , Smith is here . 
Nonsense , ninny . 
Fight back ! 
Don 't hurt me ! 
Don 't hurt me . 
So he was forced to pull in for repairs at a remote solar farm . 
- Does it hurt very much ? 
Now , while you 're faking it , I 'm gonna sneak by the guard . 
The storm 's getting worse , Dad . 
- Did you steal my comb yesterday ? 
It must be so terribly lonesome for you . 
He 's going to steal our spaceship . 
No , no . 
Nonsense . 
I think I 'm going to cry . 
Oh , try to forget your suspicions . 
Don , I wouldn 't fool with Dr. Smith right now , if I were you . 
No fooling ? 
Somebody has been very unfriendly to our mission . 
Never fear , Smith is here . 
- Never fear , Smith is here ! 
You can 't hurt us with that . 
I don 't think they 'll have any trouble . 
Oh , the hell with Gloria 's birthday , it 's my birthday . 
Right , kill the choir and dim the lights in exactly one minute . 
- Christ died for you . 
We learn how to look beyond personal disappointment . 
Then why the hell did you go away ? 
No , no message . 
Oh , the hell with Gloria 's birthday , it 's my birthday . 
Right , kill the choir and dim the lights in exactly one minute . 
- Your crazy mother , shall we cut out ? 
- Christ died for you . 
We learn how to look beyond personal disappointment . 
Then why the hell did you go away ? 
No , no message . 
I must say , I can 't fault your German . 
- I 'd hate to meet him in a dark alley . 
Not bad at all . 
Don 't worry , you 'll only be in Germany a couple of days . 
Your husband is dead . 
Did he work willingly or was he forced ? 
They need engineers too badly . 
Now , don 't worry about the girl . 
- And disobey the bad ones ? 
Now you see the problem . 
It 's a common error . 
The nothing is the thing that kills her . 
You 're wrong . 
We were going to minister to the poor . 
- And disobey the bad ones ? 
Now you see the problem . 
It 's a common error . 
The nothing is the thing that kills her . 
You 're wrong . 
We were going to minister to the poor . 
- And disobey the bad ones ? 
Now you see the problem . 
It 's a common error . 
The nothing is the thing that kills her . 
You 're wrong . 
We were going to minister to the poor . 
Damn , if I don 't . 
It 's much less offensive than " white . " 
- " To die ... " 
I know that Arthur 's dead and you killed him . 
There , that awful truck . 
- Fired into space ? 
What the hell was that ? 
I mean , I think it 's the fault of the system . 
" I had a terrible awakening and now I ... " 
The scandal . 
No , I can 't hurt them like this . 
Poor fellow . 
Each one of them portrays a real pain . 
He thinks I have no prejudices . 
Don 't tell me you want to kill me . 
- No , no , I can 't sing . 
She still does not believe I loved him ... 
I 've been stubborn too many times . 
Tell me why that idiot went there . 
Go to hell , you two ! 
It was a mistake since the start , it was foolish of me . 
- What kind of bullshit is that ? 
Let me out of this bloody machine ! 
You got the wrong number . 
Someone has to lose . 
- The spectre of defeat . 
Have you killed him ? 
Is it a power failure ? 
No , no . 
I 'd hate to miss anything . 
What a blow it must have been , you having a failure . 
Let me out of this bloody machine ! 
You got the wrong number . 
Someone has to lose . 
- The spectre of defeat . 
Have you killed him ? 
- Dimitri ! ls it a power failure ? 
No , no . 
I 'd hate to miss anything . 
What a blow it must have been , you having a failure . 
Let me out of this bloody machine ! 
You got the wrong number . 
Someone has to lose . 
- The spectre of defeat . 
Have you killed him ? 
- Dimitri ! ls it a power failure ? 
No , no . 
I 'd hate to miss anything . 
What a blow it must have been , you having a failure . 
Let me out of this bloody machine ! 
Someone has to lose . 
The spectre of defeat . 
Have you killed him ? 
Is treated with equal contempt . 
- Is it a power failure ? 
I hate to think I 'm gonna miss anything . 
What a blow it must have been , you having a failure . 
Let me out of this bloody machine ! 
You got the wrong number . 
Someone has to lose . 
- The spectre of defeat . 
Have you killed him ? 
- Dimitri ! ls it a power failure ? 
No , no . 
I 'd hate to miss anything . 
What a blow it must have been , you having a failure .

It was such a long time ago there was a war ... 
Let 's be quits with the devil . 
The self cannot be realized by the weak . 
After killing seven soldiers , Haraprasad died . 
He is guilty . 
This is quite ridiculous . 
- It 's a pack of lies . 
To catch the murderer . 
Was he killed ? 
Maybe he wants us to think he 's dead . 
But maybe they 're hurt . 
But frightening . 
The worst .

I always had a weakness for shiny gold nuggets . 
The murderer took the money and set the fire . 
Is it the mountain that makes the dead people talk ? 
Poor little thumb ! 
I didn 't steal it . 
There is no doubt . 
If you had rejected me I would have been on the street . 
If it is fake , I will never see you again . 
You are probably alone and sad . 
Dead bodies ! 
Could they have mutually strangled each other ? 
Do you think I have something to do with this suicide ? 
Numata and Kijima were weak . 
Bastard ! 
So are you only guilty of taking the money ?

Guilty of turning a scribbler into a force to be feared . 
- Don 't worry . 
- Didn 't they destroy them ? . 
- You 've gone mad !

Defeat all . 
Then how can you take your revenge ? 
I 'd rather die under your stick . 
You 're lying to me 
Bullshit ! 
I 'd rather die . 
Sorry for not welcoming you . 
Sorry to disturb you . 
We are in search of our enemy , and also relatives . 
Let 's practice for the revenge . 
It 's a bad morning . 
ln which case , you 're likely to drown .

Lying is the basic cardinal sin of mankind . 
An obligation is more terrifying than a right . 
That 's wrong . 
The image of violence .

" Stop acting dumb " . 
I was ready , but you just want to torture me !

She died last Friday , and Saturday I went to the Family Bureau . 
The usual dirty persons ! 
Come on , don 't get upset ! 
How the hell did I get here ? 
The war 's been over a long time , Jeff . 
First , what about the war ? 
These generals , they always give me heart attacks . 
- Damn it . 
I came to the conclusion you 're a hell of a guy . 
If that fails ? 
I wouldn 't worry , major . 
- Yeah , I was in the war . 
Dead ? 
Customs of the devil , sir priest . 
Small loss when the Frisians killed him . 
Then why do you weep ? 
But how this touches on your problem ... 
Try and forget the pain . 
But he was already dead .

I raged last night . 
Carry it all on your broad back , your sins and mine .

I could be a femme fatale and a devil to anyone except you 
You 're wrong 
I could have strangled him to death easily 
I hate men 
Coward 
Not till you 're dead 
I 'm a lousy cook 
I stayed in bad awake ... 
Does it still hurt ? 
Just another loose , wicked girl ? 
I was sick , desperate . 
The lake hides the ruins of a town . 
Dead ? 
I didn 't want to leave but the news tortured me . 
Damn you all ! 
Tilde wouldn 't have killed herself over such a thing . 
His ambiguous figure , his sensuality , disgusted me .

The infamous slave markets are only a sad memory of long ago . 
In spite of any gossip , these are the roosters of our South . 
They 're killers . 
Don 't mean no trouble . 
Unelss I was sick . 
They 're killers . 
Don 't mean no trouble . 
Unless I was sick . 
99 , danger is a way of life to me . 
So , Hanlon , you 're the leader of this little conspiracy . 
If there 's anything I hate , it 's a joiner . 
I want to get that madman , no matter how dangerous it is . 
We 're hopelessly lost . 
I knew when I killed Agent 27 you would come hunting me . 
I could kill you very easily . 
Now how about weapons ? 
He was a KAOS killer . 
We have to shoot and kill and destroy . 
You look terrible , 54 . 
That 's probably how he died , Max -- suffocation by paint . 
Now , think , Max -- did Agent 54 say anything before he died ? 
I don 't see what 's wrong with it . 
- Is this a dangerous assignment ? 
Don 't worry about me , Chief . 
Because , 99 , I happen to be an expert on weapons . 
There 's no electric eye , no alarm systems . 
I knew it was too bad for somebody . 
It 's those piercing black eyes , that cruel mouth . 
My gosh , we could lose the whole Midwest . 
- What I mean is , do I look dangerous ? 
Don 't worry . 
And this is the poison lipstick . 
Quite dead . 
Don 't worry . 
Then the poison lipstick . 
- Now listen , Walters -- - I 'm warning you , 86 . 
Mmm , poor Hymie . 
Grief , what was that ? 
One false move and you 're a dead man . 
KAOS has offered a quarter of million dollars for my death ! 
I 'll kill him myself . 
Are you going to kill me ? 
We 've done exhaustive research on the study of pain . 
- Ah , you are unfair , Hans . 
I didn 't have the heart to kill him . 
It was a wrong number and Mr. Siegfried is asleep . 
I think I may have just made a terrible mistake . 
What if this coffee is poisoned ? 
If there 's any more trouble , 
He might try to shoot me , to stab me , to poison me . 
- He 's dead , 
You can 't destroy Hymie . 
They just put him together wrong . 
Max , get the gun ! 
Don 't worry , Chief . 
Now I 'm afraid I shall have to kill you both . 
Yes , Tisha , but don 't worry about it . 
Oh , I feel terribly warm . 
Of all the stupid -- 
A man does not do good work on an empty stomach . 
An automobile accident . 
Bad news , Doctor . 
- The death syrup ? 
One of these pills and the victim loses his memory for one hour . 
Max , look , they 're stealing a jeep . 
( tires screech ) ( loud crash ) 
Yes , I 'm fine , Chief , but you look terrible . 
What kind of a crazy bomb is that ? 
But you and I are sworn to kill each other on sight . 
He killed 37 people . 
This is for revenge . 
Now the world will know that KAOS keeps their threats . 
Oh , Max , what a terrible weapon of destruction . 
Kill them instantly . 
That 's ridiculous ! 
Not a bad title . 
- We got the men who tried to kill you . 
- this is an outrage ! 
- Nothing but dead ends . 
He 's regained consciousness but he 's terribly weak . 
It 's the only way to keep KAOS from killing you . 
Don 't worry , Standish . 
A thief , a kidnapper , maybe a killer . 
I suggest we check all weapons . 
You 'll be in extreme danger every minute . 
She 's a liar , 99 . 
- it was ever destroyed . 
Come on , stop crying , please . 
Why are you crying ? 
What are you crying for ? 
That 's bad . 
- Are you threatening me ? 
Did you bring the murder weapon ? 
Don 't worry about me , Chief . 
- I 'm impervious to pain . 
After all , there are no holidays in the fight against evil . 
- That was me , 86 ! 
- Poor Max . 
Next time I say torture , maybe you 'll listen . 
No , no , I 'm Milton Conrad . 
Killed by an exploding birthday cake . 
You see , I had an appointment with the murdered man . 
- Don 't argue with him ! 
I still say he 's lying . 
Do you know what Mr. Gazzman 's death means ? 
- will try to kill you . 
Perhaps poison needle , perhaps strangulation . 
How horrible . 
Did you find the killer ? 
- So Conrad killed Colonel Forsythe . 
As long as I have to go on a suicide mission , 
Six destroyers headed right for our position ? ! 
Nonsense , Max . 
Don 't be a grouch ! 
" Will not rest until I have killed you in cold blood . 
The same poison ? 
I have no doubt that I can find an antidote . 
I 'm gonna die at 1 : 00 tomorrow . 
- Not ill , 99 . 
The Chief is really furious . 
Just before he died , he told me everything . 
Ridiculous ! 
You 're a bad bad man . 
Kill them both . 
The border lies over those hills . 
Sometimes fate makes the wrong men kings . 
Oh , poor Max ! 
- Are you looking for trouble ? 
If I remember correctly , you were just about to kill us . 
Oh , Max , we couldn 't be in worse trouble . 
I may be able to save America from a terrible catastrophe . 
- Did you hate him ? 
Will you stop whining ? 
Anybody makes a false move -- you 're dead . 
His days and nights of fear and hiding are behind him . 
You lose . 
But Max , how could I be so blind ? 
- Oh , Max , you saved me from making a terrible mistake . 
If you don 't put it away in exactly two seconds , you 're fired . 
And don 't you worry either , 13 . 
A warped barrel is a fool 's frustration . 
I 'm scared . 
( battery whines ) 
- No , no no ! 
My old enemy Siegfried . 
20 minutes till doomsday and he stops to take a bath ! 
and now I am going to destroy your half of the world alone . 
There 's no way to avoid it . 
This is terrible . 
My predecessor left that in kind of a mess . 
We kill him , of course . 
On second thought , I think we should insult the chef . 
No , no . 
Oh , Max , the funeral of a double agent is a sad thing . 
Kubacheck might kill him . 
Now , all we have to see is that you don 't hurt yourself . 
If you lose , I kill you . 
- Uh , no no no no . 
They 're filled with violence . 
He 'll kill her , Max . 
- ( dull thump ) 
Oh , Max , I 'm so nervous . 
Oh , Max , I 'm so nervous ! 
Firing squad , attention ! 
Wrong . 
But I 'll tell you this much -- I think it 's a rotten idea . 
You could 've given me a heart attack . 
She did die without revealing it , didn 't she , Mr. Vogel ? 
Oh , I 'm terribly sorry . 
( sobs ) 
You 'll hurt yourself . 
Oh , Max , he 's dead . 
That dirty old dump ? 
That 's the way I always die , fat man . 
Oh , how terrible . 
You are the injured couple . 
This is a dangerous assignment . 
Don 't worry , Chief . 
And this room is the fear- gas chamber . 
People hate . 
Hymie , you 're in danger , real danger . 
No offense , Hymie . 
CONTROL built a ghost town across the street from a ghost town ? 
Groppo was evil . 
Five , four , three , two , one , fire ! 
It means the man behind all this is the evil genius Dr. Yes . 
You see , the tip is poisoned . 
I think you 're wrong about her . 
That 's too bad . 
What did she do , steal them ? 
Oh , Max , she may be a pain in the neck and a busybody , 
Don 't worry , I 'll keep her busy in the kitchen . 
They 'll be destroyed . 
Stop worrying , 99 . 
It 's booby- trapped . 
That will be an awful lot of letters , Max . 
( yells ) Fire ! 
What a shame . 
The Ginsburg papers have been stolen . 
Don 't worry , Chief . 
Nonsense . 
Ugh , will you look at the dust on that lamp ? 
No , no , no . 
I 'm absolutely exhausted . 
Then this friend of mine finally died of kidney trouble . 
- That was a terrible thing . 
- I know it , that 's what worries me . 
This is the worst assignment we 've ever been given . 
- Mmm , she might even try to kill him . 
Should you decide not to accept it , you 're fired . 
Well , he 's been working very hard and he 's very tired . 
No no , 99 , that 's not what I want to say . 
That 's terrible . 
Dickie Smothers , or Anna Magnani . 
Max , you did not hand me the car keys ! 
No , no , my dear , this is all wrong . 
To think I broke up my own marriage . 
I 'd rather be in trouble with the president . 
- Is he dead ? 
If only he had used his genius for niceness instead of evil . 
And through it all , you shall be powerless to stop me . 
- And don 't worry . 
You don 't have to worry about that . 
And lose five bucks ? 
You and those stupid pools . 
Kendall , you 've got a gun ! 
Don 't be so nervous , Max . 
It 's brand- new and I don 't want to ruin it ! 
Don 't worry , Busby . 
Don 't worry , Busby , 
- It wasn 't her fault . 
I 'll run and you shoot at me ! 
The whole countryside is lousy with fuzz . 
That 's KAOS 's smuggling unit . 
Look , business has been terrible . 
This is absolutely ridiculous ! 
In view of the recent rash of robberies , 
You used to kill and maim ! 
No , don 't worry about 99 . 
You don 't have to worry about sitting down on the barstool . 
- The man 's dead . 
Oh , I 'm so embarrassed . 
I 'm so sleepy , so tired . 
That woman has the worst voice I ever heard . 
( crying ) 
- Don 't worry , 99 . 
What about the Carpenter murder case ? 
By then , you 'll be dead . 
- but no one would believe him . 
That ends Professor Stanislavski 's mad scheme . 
There 's been an accident , Miss Blake . 
Too bad that 's not a crossword puzzle . 
- Can you scream ? 
Mr. Smart , 12 people have been brutally murdered here in London . 
Idiot ! 
- No no no no no no no , stay here . 
Developing a negative . 
You said yourself that she 's been dead for 20 years . 
Max , how terrible . 
And as for Jason , he 's a thief , a liar and a blackmailer . 
Randolph was discovered in his bathtub -- drowned . 
- all those men are dead ! 
Well , that must mean he 's dead , Chief . 
But this is ridiculous ! 
And she 's sick ? 
- Don 't worry , Chief , nothing will . 
You found Dietrich and you killed him . 
This may be the old bomb- in- the- bonbon- box trick . 
That 's a bomb if I ever heard one . 
99 , don 't you worry about the twins . 
Memorize that , Zachary , then destroy the paper . 
It 's really no trouble at all , Mr. Ambassador . 
( baby crying ) 
She 's in no immediate danger . 
All right , you big ugly gorilla , 
- It died . 
Aw , that 's a shame . 
( gun firing ) 
These men were stealing a painting . 
That 's the trouble , 99 . 
He 's gonna fill this room with water and try and drown us ! 
- ( cries ) 
Sign or die . 
But isn 't he in prison ? 
You folks got a problem ? 
We 're saying that you can walk right out of this prison . 
Until the Whip is caught , this gun is our responsibility . 
Then I didn 't steal the Narco 512 . 
Fu Yung : 
Then we 'll have her for murder . 
It 's tough to beat a murder rap . 
( organ music playing ) ( sobs ) 
Don 't worry , Chief . 
The pains are coming 10 minutes apart now . 
Now if we just don 't get a bad break . 
- The bad break . 
No , Max , I don 't want you to arrest him then . 
Now if we just don 't get a bad break . 
One of my men has had a slight accident . 
I 'm terribly sorry . 
Oh , you want me to tell him my little doggie 's very sick . 
Don 't worry , Big Eddie . 
- Yes , kill him ! 
What a shame . 
Air raid warning ! 
Battery : fire ! 
Fire ! 
The final stage of the war has begun - the war of nerves . 
Oh , no , no , no . 
Don 't worry about a thing . 
With couples snuggling every place , just terrible . 
- I 'm not used to being abandoned . 
There 'll be no more interruptions . 
Don 't have to worry . 
Poor guy . 
For all the misery he 's going through .

The room service is lousy . 
- I 'm not sticking up for him , I hate him . 
Oh , no , no , no .

The smallest mistake can have serious consequences . 
Cruchot , poor guy . 
That 's very bad . 
I broke my leg . 
Sorry , ma 'am , wrong room . 
I didn 't mean to disturb you . 
What 's wrong ?

It 's a complete catastrophe !

What a wanker . 
I have a piece of bad news . 
At Heartbreak Hotel 
He also died in mysterious circumstances . 
It 's my fault . 
Kick my ass .

You have elderly got sick , right ? 
Now , you 're poor . 
If I counted on you , I 've already died of hunger . 
Why are you crying ? 
Last night , you scared me . 
Don 't panic .

Don 't you know exaggerated lies do cheat people ? 
You 're ungrateful ! 
She said your dad 's sent to the hospital 'cos of heart attack . 
Madam , Mr. Feng had a heart attack . 
Cheating me again ? 
If everyone comes here to cry , we 'll have a big trouble . 
If they encounter a live spirit they 'll die ! 
What can anyone steal from me ? 
Do you suffer a hangover ? 
It 's my life that has become difficult ! 
- Someone has murdered Mr. Sharma . 
But the rest of you will die of starvation . 
Actually , I died the day you called me Rake . 
Isn 't it possible that Rakesh is the murderer ? 
He too will be murdered . 
You would have been dead long ago . 
She committed suicide . 
Many of them were victims of the war . 
- Don 't worry . 
This is a bad break . 
It would be terrible if we made a mistake . 
As a scientist , I didn 't want him to be killed . 
There were lots of them just after the war . 
Drop dead ! 
VlCTlM OF A- BOMB ? 
Hundreds of thousands of people were killed . 
It would be terrible if we made a mistake . 
- Is anything wrong ? 
He 'll lose ! 
- The Atomic Bomb dome in Hiroshima . 
He didn 't say things in a distorted way . 
But I was scared to go in as a child . 
- it 's a bit distorted . 
He 's being sucked into the water . 
Frankenstein . - it 's a sad ending , isn 't it ? 
The Hexer is the killer ? 
- The commons ' meeting was scandalous . 
This scream , Lady Aston , how long was it ? 
- Fatal ? 
He was mean , arrogant and treacherous . 
When it comes to murder , I want to get to know the victim . 
- No doubt but ... supposedly he also had enemies . 
Except for his suicide . 
Murder ? 
Fear , insomnia , nightmares and its causes . 
You are very suspicious , Margie . 
The evenings are horrible . 
How do you kill ? 
Do I have a reason to fear this night ? 
He is dead . 
Very hot temper . 
- He is already dead ! 
I would have never survived that car . 
It was a ... stupid idea , to team up with him ! 
' NO ONE CAN SElZE THOSE TWO , THlS ONE . 
- No , I had a bad dream ... 
Stop crying . 
- I 'm so sick of carrying water . 
Don 't worry about the gossip . 
Shit ...

Well , and if there 's no war for a hundred years ... 
- I was getting real scared , they 'd bring us that bottle ! 
- So why 're you being stupid now ? ! 
- Why would I be scared ? 
Your whole life lies ahead . 
Stop saying such stupid things ! 
- He 's stupid ! 
I made that closet and I covered the cabinet , it was awful . 
I hate old cabinets . 
I didn 't think it was going to be so horrible . 
So , she died six months ago ? 
I know how awful that is . 
Fight against your fears to find out what 's happening . 
' Dead ' , yes ! you have to get used to that word . 
- Did you take part in the war ? 
I don 't even doubt your remorse . 
The fool of a Kaiser , the fool of a Kaiser ... 
I kept Edith until the fluttering bird killed her . 
Are the Trischlers really dead ? 
- Did you take part in the war ? 
I don 't even doubt your remorse . 
The fool of a Kaiser , the fool of a Kaiser ... 
I kept Edith until the fluttering bird killed her . 
Are the Trischlers really dead ? 
- Why do you look so pained ? 
You wicked foreigner . 
Why the devil not ? 
Trouble in the Bois de Boulogne . 
The shame ! 
We forget disappointments quickly . 
- The bomb . 
You stink of tobacco , your nails are filthy . 
He 'll fail , and take you with him . 
- I hate music . 
You 've made your fortune ... but you 're lonely . 
- I don 't want to lose my temper . 
Don 't forget your bomb this time . 
Engineer Vegliotti has constructed a bomb - 
- We are wasted on each other . 
He has decreed a general amnesty for all political prisoners . 
No- No , sir . 
How many men have you killed ? 
We don 't want any bad reputations around here . 
But I 've got the same trouble Mom had- no cash . 
Hold fire ! 
If we all get killed , nobody 's going to run . 
Throw me a gun ! 
How many men have you killed ? 
We moved over just after Pa died . 
We don 't want any bad reputations around here . 
Kill again ? 
If we all get killed out of this , nobody 's going to run .

The more you love , the more painful death becomes . 
A policeman 's hurt . 
I must say that I was very uncomfortable to be with women . 
So that this killer cult will never again threaten Japan ! 
She said there 's still a lot of antagonism against us . 
Spiritual suffering befalls those who are left by the ordained . 
Sick of worry ? 
It 's us who called the police , and we were attacked ! 
You wanna drop the charges ? 
No tricks , I warn you . 
It 's easy to kill . 
Don 't write anything bad about her . 
I 'd say she 's a bit slutty . 
We nearly died ! 
Just ask their Chief Editor to apologize and let things die down . 
The house owner will drop the charges . 
We all reckoned it was a suicide . 
Cheng Fu is , in fact , the name , right ? 
There aren 't that many villains in this world as you may think . 
It wasn 't murder ... and it was me who let the suspect go . 
If I only had your worries ! 
What will people steal next ! 
An unplanned tap , a bad tap ! 
Be ashamed of yourself ! 
What a shame ! 
And the chief would be furious ! 
Damnation ! 
Oh , the shame of it ! 
If I only had your worries !

- I know you 're going to regret it . 
Stop being such smartasses . 
You know Grandpa has a bad heart . 
We have 4 on vacation , 3 are sick , 2 are doing reserve duty . 
You always used to get tired around this time . 
They all are laughing and mocking at my suffering ! 
" See , how I fooled him ! " 
" Don 't take the trouble , I 'll hear it some other time . " 
- Wherever you tell me or you may get scared . 
I got into a strange mess yesterday . 
Try to keep control or you may lose it as soon as he arrives ! 
" Nanda , are you angry with me ? " 
Why are you making me as irresponsible as you ? 
Regret not that I have been lost 
I am scared that I will lose you . 
The story is over , don 't cheat yourself anymore ! " 
' You are a coward . 
You caused me to crash my flying machine . 
The choice of weapons is yours . 
I absolutely forbid it ! 
- Anyone would think you were frightened of the fellow ! 
- Nonsense . 
- He must be mad . 
You caused me to crash my flying machine .

There 's not a chance it can fail . 
That 'll show the lousy Krauts . 
No harm in trying . 
* Boom , tararrel Norden Bomb Sight ? ! 
Something is wrong ? 
You from that big old ugly prison camp yonder ? 
Very good beer in this place , but the glasses are terrible . 
I 'm no fink and don 't ever forget it . 
No , no , no . 
Every time I tell them something , they always give me trouble . 
I hate to get you out of bed , sir . 
I worry ? 
Oh , this beer is terrible . 
Of course , a fellow could do worse . 
I will get you a work detail of prisoners from Luft Stalag 13 . 
That 's bad . 
Have to be tough with them , otherwise they do not respect you . 
You don 't have to worry on that score , sir . 
Are you suggesting that he is a liar ? 
You are a greedy , selfish person . 
But it 's going to take an awful long time to outfit 20 guys . 
Oh , you fools . 
It 's shocking . 
Dirty squealer ! 
We 're here to meet an escaped prisoner from Stalag 5 . 
Nasty rain and all that . 
I 'm on the go 24 hours a day running a model prisoner camp . 
You owe it to the war effort , sir . 
Destroyed ? 
Fire ! 
All of my prisoners were accounted for at roll call . 
This is terrible ! 
We will find something wrong , believe me . 
I warned them to leave me alone , and now they 're gone . 
I just busted out of another prison camp . 
Helga , a manicurist in an underground barber shop for prisoners ? 
What harm is it ? 
He has a pass , but they have no record of him entering . 
All prisoners . 
The usual punishment ? 
I , of course , have no anxiety . 
It 's a complicated war , Olsen . 
It 's everybody 's fault , Colonel . 
It is only a smoke bomb . 
That makes him senior prisoner of war officer . 
Uh , " Die Walkure " or " The Ride of the Valkyries . " 
Come on , Carter , don 't be negative . 
Tell Kinch to notify London about the new prisoner . 
No , that 's wrong ! 
They 're jealous . 
Fire ! 
A fire hose ! 
Gosh , I hate to leave here . 
I 'd rather be a live failure than a dead hero . 
As long as Klink is unhappy and can 't sleep . 
I still say he looks like a dead fish . 
Lies . 
Colonel Hogan , this is hopeless . 
And to think that I said he looked like a dead fish . 
tired , hungry , alone ... 
They are my prisoners . 
you prisoners . 
Trouble , Colonel ? 
That 's a shame . 
Terrible . 
I 'm an escaped American prisoner from Stalag 13 . 
You ruddy fool ! 
Three prisoners . 
No prisoner is allowed to carry a gun . 
Major Bonacelli returning your prisoners . 
Ah , but don 't worry about that . 
Don 't worry . 
Didn 't they bomb ... ? 
There 's a new prisoner coming in today . 
So , this is the new prisoner , huh ? 
No spy would start off by antagonizing everybody . 
Is it one of the new prisoners ? 
Wrong , Commandant . 
Tillman is a sick man . 
Schultz is right , and you 're wrong . 
Oh , no , no ... ( ) 
This man 's in league with the devil . 
You have a very suspicious nature . 
It is impossible for us to lose the war . 
It 's against the Geneva Convention to keep a prisoner prisoner . 
Denied . 
Denied . 
But I wonder about this anti - Hitler conspiracy they mention . 
Where can I turn for help with this terrible problem ? 
Somebody might get hurt , or worse . 
Now , then ... what sort of mischief did you have in mind for me ? 
Sounds dreadfully important . 
What is this prisoner doing out of camp ? 
Always Berlin sends their problems to Klink . 
Shame on you . 
I will personally poison your food . 
Nothing to worry about . 
He may make it through , but I doubt it . 
Oh , you are both jealous . 
Don 't worry , he 'll make it . 
I just don 't want anybody to get hurt . 
We will the war any minute ! 
Since when have you become so suspicious ? 
If we ever start fighting this war with pins , your side may win . 
No , no , no , no , no , Herr General . 
You have proof that this gun exists ? 
Colonel , are you offering my men work in a war plant ? 
Stupidity ? 
We really are a nasty lot , we are . 
You , sir , are my prisoner . 
Kills me to see those rats in Paris . 
I got into the wrong conversation . 
With this , I 'll make my contribution to defeat the Germans . 
Ugh , forget it . 
In fact , before the war , he was an art student . 
Nobody saw the truck or the prisoner . 
A direct attack ? 
A scandal like this could destroy the Third Reich . 
No trouble at all . 
After our war games , 
lying on the ground . 
Causing such trouble on my birthday -- 
I worry about people , Schultz . 
Oh , that 's terrible . 
I 'm terribly sorry , sir . 
It 's an unfair test . 
You see , I am the reason you are now here a prisoner of war . 
No , no , your tactical planning , Colonel . 
Unfortunately , there 's a war going on . 
In case they attack , 
Not a bad idea . 
No , no , no , Schultz . 
Trouble . 
Oh , just a discussion of prison problems , General Burkhalter . 
You convicted the wrong man ! 
Cease fire , or I will shoot Burkhalter ! 
No , no , no , Schultz , you mean you just can 't resist them . 
Boy , what a war . 
You obviously know we 're prisoners in Luft Stalag 13 . 
Yeah , but this time for fake diamonds . 
And Major Hegel was the only one who was killed ? 
A filthy , rotten mug 's game . 
Treason ! 
Your first attack of the war ! 
You mean they are going to fight a battle among themselves ? 
No mistake . 
Could 've been panic among the prisoners . 
It is terrible , the smoke ... 
Captured the prisoners . 
You wouldn 't be so upset if it was an old code book . 
Nobody contradicts Colonel Klink ! 
Klink , we 've had some disturbing reports recently . 
There will be severe punishment for this . 
Oh , sir , I wouldn 't call that a failure . 
You 'll never get a better chance to learn . 
Back ... back from the prisoner . 
That maniac could toss a grenade in this office any time . 
Too bad , too bad . 
Schultz , you 're an idiot . 
They will seek to poison me . 
Here to kill Hitler . 
He just arrested you . 
Are you insulting my adjutant ? 
If that happens , I do not want to be on the losing side . 
Nobody drops dead just to prove a point . 
You are under arrest ! 
Nonsense . 
He 's a mess ! 
If he broke down , he 'd be in line for a sick leave . 
Poor Schultz . 
He 's terribly sorry for the treatment he 's given you . 
You are lying . 
Actors are all unstable and French actors are the worst . 
I wasn 't throwing any temper tantrums . 
That 's a riot . 
Klink is not responsible for the sabotage . 
Sad world . 
I don 't , but I have no choice . 
I can 't find anything wrong . 
Let 's not turn it into a suicide mission . 
A riot ? 
This must be destroyed immediately . 
Make this a dancing war . 
My engine started going bad . 
I 'll hold the bloody Germans up with me bare hands . 
Stand back , you bloody mug , unless you want to get killed . 
And what 's wrong with my eyes ? 
A plane with engine trouble ? 
It 's kind of a disturbing thought . 
You 're jealous of Bobo . 
But , since he has these unfair suspicions , 
If your information is wrong , I shall be looking for you . 
We cannot trust Hitler to shoot all his own generals . 
They 're gonna kill me ! 
Schultz , prepare my quarters for the defector . 
Carter , don 't worry . 
He wants us to give Carter back to them so they can kill him . 
If Freitag knows about us ... why weren 't we arrested ? 
I 've got an awful lot of back pay coming . 
There are limits to how much stupidity I will put up with . 
Colonel Klink is sick . 
No problem . 
But that 's nonsense . 
It 's a shame . 
RAF colonel , trained commando , sabotage expert . 
Colonel Klink , you 're an evil man . 
Bad news . 
Too bad . 
I do not trust them . 
But , sir , it was really an exhausting chase . 
18 fliers broke out two days ago . 
I just want you to get the prisoner Newkirk back here at once ! 
The weapons carriers are a half mile outside the perimeter . 
Fraternizing with the prisoners , is it ? 
That 's very bad . 
I feel terrible . 
No , because I leave no one behind . 
Falls for Poor slob . a phony . 
You know my door is always open when my men have problems . 
And what 's worse , you 're a fool 's idea of a fool . 
Don 't worry , Schultz . 
It 's illegal . 
Hogan , this is your fault , and you 've got do something ! 
Well , I suppose a P. O. W. camp is a necessary evil . 
Uh , no complaints , are there ? 
You see , my men are prisoners in name only . 
All I want is to end the war . 
No , sir , no . 
You devil . 
Disgrace to the uniform . 
" Stoffel , your life is in danger . 
And , even though the building was destroyed 
He wants to make you look bad . 
Only 12 prisoners . 
You 're not giving comfort and aid to the enemy . 
No wonder you lost the West . 
No one is to interfere with his prisoners . 
Now that the war is over , 
Hogan , the war is over ! 
Wilhelm , if you work for me after the war , 
I mean , if they kill him , they kill him . 
And besides , how bad can he be , this Klink ? 
She gets you alone in the inn , no telling what might happen . 
To me it is ... ugly ... ugly . 
We can get together after the war . 
Bombing failed , so my guess is they 'll try a commando raid . 
Klink , you 're making a fool of yourself . 
He 's brutal , sir , brutal . 
Now , now , Schultz , don 't cry . 
Don 't worry about it . 
My fault ? 
Now I am in very deep trouble with the Gestapo . 
let us run the prison camps . 
Uh , no smoking and no moving around . 
That 's right , " Killer . " 
It was an obvious case of mass temporary insanity . 
You 're a menace . 
No , no . 
I don 't tell you how to be a prisoner of war . 
" You 'll assist escaping prisoners , 
You know your situation , of course , is hopeless . 
The Russian front -- a defeat everywhere . 
Either you 're not laughing or we 're having a bad connection . 
He just doesn 't understand my problems . 
There 's no sign of trouble , sir . 
In our spare time , a little sabotage . 
You could get us all killed . 
No magic , no tricks . 
Your life insurance premiums must be murder . 
It 's a nice place to have a war , but I 'd hate to live here . 
That is the curse of being a humble man . 
" in that training crash . 
No reason to suspect them . 
Carter made it through the main gate with no problems . 
If he makes one wrong move , shoot to kill . 
The prisoners were with me at the time , sir . 
Don 't worry , mate . 
Yes , but Klink is such a stupid one . 
It 's no use trying to fool you . 
The same dull stuff we 've been doing . 
The wrong one ? 
Poor man . 
Fighting the war to our full capacity . 
Anything wrong ? 
No , but you 'll do until something bad comes along . 
Poor man . 
That would be fine if our purpose was to lose the war . 
Then I 'd stop worrying . 
I 'm out of practice -- the war . 
I have a way of destroying them . 
And after the war , what will you do ? 
Don 't shoot ! 
He is terrible . 
Get killed trying ? 
Who would be jealous of Schultz ? 
LeBeau , bad taste . 
Pick up your check , get out of World War Il . " 
Don 't shoot ! 
Nobody deserves that kind of punishment . 
It 's a terrible place to visit , but I would hate to live here . 
In a prison camp ? 
Prisoner of war camp ? 
The Gestapo will kill your Englishman . 
No , no , the headache took my appetite away . 
I take it my job is to destroy the factory , eh ? 
These gentlemen went to a lot of trouble to come and see you . 
Is there something wrong with the wine ? 
Oh , it 's a rotten shame . 
Those are killers . 
Don 't worry , there 's plenty left for you . 
The Swiss Prison Commission is coming tomorrow . 
I do not make deals with prisoners of war . 
" World War Klink " ? 
Don 't worry about the dishes , 
The mission failed , Colonel , it 's finished and that 's that . 
Now , I told you it might be dangerous . 
Major Hermann reports the fire is out of control , a total loss . 
Two of my men , before the war , were interior decorators . 
And sabotage on the ground . 
Don 't bother me ! 
Dangerous ? 
That , uh ... wouldn 't hurt . 
You know , I have been thinking that after the war 
Do you think London could be wrong , sir ? 
Von Krubner is dead . 
Hogan , stop your foolish little game . 
Here , does that hurt ? 
Not dead , maybe a little sick . 
The men hoped you 'd give him severe punishment , sir . 
Prisoners of war delivering ammunition all over Germany . 
I didn 't waste my time hanging around pool halls 
Something wrong ? 
Don 't be an idiot ? 
Before this war is over , you will see the insignia right here . 
The war is over ? 
The theory will be a submarine attack or a giant mine . 
You think there 's any danger here ? 
Defected to the Nazis . 
Unfortunately , the Führer would be disappointed , too . 
Colonel Hogan , you were stupid to come back to Stalag 13 . 
Negative , Goldilocks . 
That could be bad news . 
Gee , what a shame he didn 't get more of you in here , sir . 
You don 't fool me , LeBeau . 
I hate a war where people drop in unexpectedly . 
And then we steal back from them . 
Who told you to start a war ? 
Dead . 
The trouble is he never says anything . 
The suspense isn 't killing me anymore . 
There 's no danger . 
The underground courier system has been broken . 
You 're cruel , sir , taunting me with that rare antique . 
That 's our fault . 
Sergeant Schultz tells me he was not treated with any disrespect . 
Don 't worry , Colonel Hogan . 
Well , no sense crying over spilled cream . 
But he might have had all of us killed , too . 
It 's an outrage . 
All right , I 'm sorry for disturbing you . 
And the location of the bloody J- 4 rockets . 
What do you got to lose , sir ? 
Oh , don 't worry . 
It 's been a long war , sir . 
To the war ! 
Carter , get outside , start the attack . 
This whole miserable scheme was yours from the beginning . 
In spite of the attack , not one , single prisoner is missing . 
That Bruno 's a real killer . 
I just hate the idea of commanding Hogan 's Cowards . 
Oh , that 's horrible . 
Don 't worry about a thing . 
I 'm terribly sorry . 
How can a prisoner send a wire , Hogan ? 
And then I will take killing myself . 
I 'll go AWOL from two armies at the same time . 
That 's very sad -- oh . 
There 's no need to get alarmed . 
Wrong , Commandant . 
Three tugs means trouble , stay down . 
Don 't hurt him . 
She could not trust herself . 
Oh , no , no , no . 
Oh , how sad . 
Oh , it 's terribly cold . 
Our orders are to destroy the pumps . 
Uh- uh , wrong . 
That 'd be asking for trouble . 
That 's terrible . 
If you are caught , it will ruin your operation at Stalag 13 . 
He can be declared legally dead at any time . 
I am not a beautiful woman . 
Colonel , you 're a bloody genius . 
No problem , for Newkirk . 
No problem , Colonel . 
You 're cruel , Hogan . 
Something wrong ? 
I 'd rather you have it than some contemptible sneak thief . 
We changed Newkirk 's punishment to solitary confinement . 
No , no , no , no , allow me . 
You 're probably right -- poor man . 
I revoke all punishment . 
If I destroy the negative or give it to you , 
No , you do have a problem . 
Oh , I couldn 't take money from the prisoners . 
Boy , what a wreck . 
The destruct mechanism failed . 
I mean , charity should transcend even the hatred of war . 
" You know , Klink was a lousy chairman . 
To keep the prisoners occupied . 
It was just an accident . 
( ) Oh , this is too bad . 
I 'm surprised you haven 't stolen World War Il . 
Herr Kommandant , false alarm ! 
Herr Kommandant , the prisoners -- I captured them ! 
He was informed the prisoners would be found here . 
Not too bad . 
I think you 're in trouble , Fred . 
* Poverty ... may come to me 
You hated it . 
Why is he so nervous ? 
Oh , the enemy ! 
Don 't worry , Colonel . 
Nonsense . 
Face it , Hogan -- for you and your men this war is over . 
The traffic was terrible . 
Hold your fire , lads ! 
This one 's do or die -- a suicide mission . 
Scheming troublemaker . 
Is there some trouble , Colonel ? 
No matter , no matter . 
That stuff 's dangerous . 
Oh , that was stupid . 
And you think it would be wrong ? 
Now , that 's what I call a problem . 
I will take your prisoner to Stalag 13 . 
I only hope I am in on the kill ! 
No , no , no , Hogan . 
You have the prisoners cowed . 
They didn 't even stay and fight ! 
The suspense is killing me . 
So hot in fact , it is doing considerable damage to the 
I 've been too busy stealing planes to think about it . 
The war can 't last forever . 
Now , you say the enemy is planning a new attack . 
Of course he 's unhappy ; who wouldn 't be ? 
No , no . 
No , no . 
I would say that you run the camp , and Klink is your prisoner . 
Oh , what a shame . 
No problem . 
You 're the most nervous war hero I 've ever known . 
Treason ? 
He is guilty . 
Not since the war . 
Now , you say that Hauptmann is guilty , and I say you 're right . 
You mean you think he 's guilty again ? 
Not a sign of poison . 
That would be a problem . 
Maybe we 'll see each other again after the war . 
A shame . 
Release the prisoner to Sergeant Duclos . 
Stealing it ? 
I 've had only one accident . 
Oh , it was terrifying , Otto , terrifying . 
Until your rotten prisoners took it ! 
Everybody under arrest ! 
You will cooperate ... or suffer the consequences . 
That 's why it 's taking them so long to lose the war . 
I could have you arrested and shot as a spy . 
We 're wasting our time with this lot , Colonel . 
And to keep it a secret they 're killing the lot of you , eh ? 
You go to England my way , or you die my way . 
The war will go on without you . 
Colonel Klink , the prison commandant , is with him . 
No , no , not that , sir . 
' Cause I 'm a wine snob and this just doesn 't make it . 
Boy , he could fool me . 
Request denied . 
Denied . 
Don 't worry about the dogs , we feed them , they 're tame . 
Yeah , that 's war . 
If it doesn 't , we 're in a lot of trouble . 
Have I ever failed you before ? 
395th Bomb Squadron . 
395th bomb Dusseldorf ? 
Klink must be an idiot . 
Someday we 'll steal a train , we 've got ourselves a subway . 
if there is a repetition , the punishment will be doubled . 
Either a German or one of our boys gone bad . 
Imagine , Hochstetter ruined ... and a whole train blown up . 
Can 't really blame you , sir . 
He turned out to be just another big , nasty Kraut . 
What a shame . 
Not bad , huh ? 
Oh , his German 's bloody awful . 
It 's Klink 's version of the Chinese water torture . 
This is Colonel Hogan , senior prisoner of war officer . 
You prisoners of war . 
Ah , don 't worry , Commandant , you 'll find another girl . 
Don 't waste any time ; get going . 
Don 't worry . 
There 's no mistake ? 
Oh , you 're both just jealous of my assignment . 
He says we 're jealous ' cause he 's going into town . 
You 'd be killed by the bombs on the way back . 
Everybody that wants to hear the bad news first ? 
With your cold , it could be dangerous . 
- Not aboard an American destroyer . 
Captain , would you attack a Russian submarine ? 
And the kill , my captain ? 
Remember that Russian sub that was forced to surface off of Cuba ? 
You must be tired . 
- Down there , the stink begins . 
Damn ! 
Don 't worry . 
It irritates me . 
It 's unfair . 
My girlfriend got sick , so she rented her apartment . 
My father was furious . 
He went home sick and broke . 
" Racing horses stolen in Paris . " 
Too bad ! 
You 're crazy ! 
Did I hurt you ? 
Liar ! 
You make me sick . 
Are you mad at me ? 
I didn 't want to hurt him . 
Idiot ! 
Damn !

I 'll turn you in for your own crime . 
And me , you don 't hate me ? 
- Liar ! 
Dirty trick ! 
Don 't kill the goose with the golden eggs ! 
She killed herself and I have to pay back her debt . 
No , no ! 
" What can I do to make you as miserable as possible ? " 
Do you want to die ? 
I 'll kill you ! 
Oh , Tracy , I 'm no coward , it 's just ... 
Come here , you little coward . 
No , no , I don 't need the stimulation of alcohol . 
But I invited this poor soul to dinner . 
What bad guys ? 
Don 't you be rude to your mother . 
- But this is bad for me physically . 
- Sick ? 
I 'd hate to lose this job . 
Because at 18 I was rather stupid . 
It 'd serve him right , lying to me all these years . 
Now look , Dan , what I 'm about to tell you is unethical . 
Oh , don 't you worry . 
Oh , Tracy , I 'm no coward , it 's just --

Because at 1 8 I was rather stupid . 
WeIl , Val , you shouldn 't cry . 
Now Iook , Dan , what I 'm about to teII you is unethical . 
Oh , don 't you worry . 
Don 't you know that you nearly killed me ? 
I was scared too , so scared . 
A shot was fired by accident . 
I 've got a problem with this arm . 
- Is your grandfather alive or dead ? 
A real fool of myself . 
Stay lying down . 
You could end up in jail or even a psychiatric prison . 
I too have a weakness . 
I got time off work because of nervous exhaustion . 
They scared him . 
Bad accent ? 
You 've got to help me or they 'll kill me . 
So what 's wrong with her ? 
Damn ! 
Remember that we are all guilty . 
- No , no . 
Weeping willows ? 
Disrespect me . 
Another one was in a bomb blast . 
Death rays . 
This man that I hate makes it impossible . 
It 's fake . 
You were very annoyed to miss out on buying the dog . 
- Ruin me . 
Your days are numbered , you bastard . 
You 're ugly . 
When Babetta returns , ache will know to have made a mistake . 
Oh , no , only crazy words to a crazy tune . 
And now let 's shoot it ! 
Less than a year ago ... ... Fantomas terrorised the country . 
Yes , indeed , but don 't worry . 
This will be a disaster . 
He would have killed him . 
At the location of a destroyed city . 
- Nonsense , the tumor was already asleep . 
It 's all a pack of lies ... 
- While you 're beating ? 
Don 't you worry . 
And seems to be an extremely dangerous bodyguard at that . 
We swear we 'll behead " Red Devil " li ! 
Sir ... it was for Dojo- harassment . 
Don 't worry about the bill ... 
Don 't worry . 
Such a troublemaker ! 
That is ridiculous ! 
- Do you confess your weakness ? 
- Do you humbly confess your weakness ? 
Your heart is filled with hatred . 
All you really want is to revenge your hurt vanity . 
He is guilty and he condemned himself . 
But they were doing what was evil in my eyes . 
You have damned other people and you did not save yourself . 
Study hard , don 't fail the Prime Minister 's expectations . 
Yet I 'm just a poor scholar , 
It 's the teacher 's fault if the teaching is not proper . 
Jin Cai , Jin Fu , tie Zhang Zhen up . 
Stop making unfounded attacks . 
Don 't be rude , Peony . 
It 's so annoying that she tries to pass off as me . 
Since I 'm poor he apparently wanted to call it off . 
Real or fake , 
The anti- evil sword . 
You women ... even scared of lightning . 
From now on , we don 't need to worry about anything .

Then how can this worthless dare to sit 
Sir , what 's this , if a day gets wasted then why am I a Guide ? 
If they had to go to hell why people would come to Udaipur ? 
But still , you want to show that I torture you a lot - 
While asleep everyone is helpless 
Tell me if you get tired , I 'll not accept new programmes ! 
Rosy , why is this hatred ? 
Lmagine that your house got fired & this boy is inside 
A lot of people got hurt , isn 't it ? 
But sir , listen me , you may have mistaken me ! 
Now , I 'll fall dead then watch it 
Don’ t worry .

Don 't you get tired of your films ? 
It 's a temporary embarrassment because of the school . 
She was unhappy . 
And when you 're old ... you 're too tired to think . 
I was tired . 
But these are cruel tears . 
- Thou art to die . 
So badly acted . 
We 're building a state , and don 't even have a prison . 
A man can be killed only once . 
A man who has no fear , has no hope . 
You are a damn cheater ! 
That i left one day with my hard heart full of pain . 
Those who tried to destroy all our world , 
I can see what lies ahead . 
Killed by people who want to be important . 
They fired several lead bullets right into it . 
Montgomery Brown is dead . 
How can you leave them to suffer here . 
They must have been mad to do it . 
I’ m sorry to disappoint you boys . 
Those who tried to destroy all our world , 
Bad fucking news for you . 
We 're at war today . 
What the hell is wrong with you ? 
Nobody gets dragged into a street fight . 
He was trained to kill . 
I believe he deceived you as much as anybody else . 
This is a war . 
But the problem is e- mails can get intercepted . 
You having some car trouble ? 
Don 't worry . 
My wife wanted to divorce me because I 'm broke ! 
Õ ou 're hurting me ! 
- I 'm afraid she 's got upset !

When I get upset , it goes worse !

I 'm very upset ! 
Don 't do this , stupid ! 
Don 't worry , Stelio . 
Cut the crap , Sissy ! 
- Did it hurt ? 
And our silly daughter was jealous ! 
I 'll beat the hell out of her ! 
Fool !

- We treated him badly too . 
Listen , will it hurt you if I say something ? 
- I fear no enemy ! 
Whenever I feel your sadness , I feel restless . 
I don 't think he would flee out of fear . 
- I ask , why do you hate me so much ? 
How was I to knowthat he would indeed get drown and die ? 
We 're starting a hostel for poor students in Srinagar . 
But you knowthat she even hates the sight of me . 
I went crazy over your dance ! 
So is this how you take revenge ! 
My lips may not be the perfect pink .. 
When I feel your sadness , my nights become restless . 
O , Sunder Munder , ... may you be damned ! 
I am poor , but it 's not just a few rich people who are decent ! 
You cannot weigh the honor of a decent girl with money ! 
Has Sunder gone crazy ? ! 
lf you lose this job , you know the plight they will be in . 
So , I can think of no other way but to kill myself . 
Sunder , I wanted to kill myself . 
What 's wrong with you ? 
She fainted because of weakness . 
- Do not raise your hand ! 
This is not the time to be angry . 
I have caused you a lot of pain .

In spite ofthe tailoring .

It 's gonna take an awful lot ofhusband to keep up with you . 
Well , you should have no trouble at all . 
- You hurt me when you accuse me ofthings like that . 
No , no charge . 
Imagine going to all this trouble and expense . 
You deliberately led me on to humiliate me , and you have . 
How about your lies to me ? 
Why do idiot lesions ? 
From crop failures and hunger ,,,

Someone could steal it from here .

You wanted to kill him , didn 't you ? 
N- no , that 's where you 're wrong . 
That is an outrageous policy . 
No doubt they will attack as soon as Voyager crosses the border . 
You 've often expressed frustration with your Klingon temper . 
I knew there was something wrong . 
Do you see any problem with that , Tom ? 
You think she 'll reject me again ? 
She could die from this ? 
You 've seen the ruins ? 
There must be some kind of communications problem . 
But you 're sending out a distress call . 
What 's wrong ? 
It 's very upsetting , not at all pleasurable . 
You 're hostile and vicious . 
Transport him directly to Sick Bay . 
Send her to Sick Bay . 
We have him in our Sick Bay . 
And you 're a fool to follow her . 
The one who will destroy Grendel and end our suffering . 
I make life and death decisions every day . 
More than 300, 000 were killed . 
You indicated that he may be in some kind of danger ... 
Is that what you were doing with that thing in Sick Bay ? 
I know it was a terrible thing to lose your mother . 
Don 't worry , Tuvok . 
However , it is in violation of regulations . 
Can you pinpoint the coordinates of the distress call ? 
Not bad ... for a beginner . 
No fuss , no trouble . 
I 'd hate to lose Baxter . 
He misses his boys terribly . 
It 's a very ineffective way of waging war . 
You want me to kill a child in front of other children . 
In battle , there are no second chances . 
It appears that Voyager has suffered a ... disaster . 
What 's wrong ? 
There must be something wrong . 
Do nothing and you 'll die . 
Destroy the warp core . 
If you never had a child , would you ... be terribly unhappy ? 
It 's not my intention to harm the creature . 
But don 't worry , it 'll pass . 
Ensign , are you ill ? 
The hull is starting to buckle under the stress . 
Negative . 
I just can 't seem to stop these awful feelings . 
Am I ... discerning a personal problem here , gentlemen ? 
B 'Elanna , our shuttle 's in trouble . 
Lord Burleigh ... is something wrong ? 
Terribly wrong . 
We don 't want more trouble in our lives ! 
It 's hard to believe he almost destroyed us . 
The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere . 
Call me day or night if this gets any worse . 
But then new people came with weapons and disease . 
They 're all dead . 
And now , I will kill you . 
Negative . 
You think I 'm a fool . 
I killed them . 
So if you 're going to have me killed , just do it . 
But I saw the way you handled that ugly one . 
What are you doing with this lunatic ? 
But I was too tired , so I couldn 't see it . 
I don 't need to be threatened . 
I 'd hate to lose another shuttle . 
Captain , shields are down , as are all weapons arrays . 
Torres to Sick Bay . 
He was too badly injured . 
Shame . 
That would be dishonest , Harry . 
It is important that I understand why you killed Mr. Darwin . 
How is it going to hurt ? 
That is how we treat violent offenders on this ship , isn 't it ? 
To release your violent impulses ? 
Oh , I 'm hurt . 
Oh , just killing time . 
Problem , Lieutenant ? 
They don 't dare feel sad . 
My own aversion to suicide . 
He was right when he said the Continuum scared me back in line . 
I have accepted the fact that I will die soon . 
It 's considered to be a threat to public health . 
My problem is you . 
I fail to see a connection . 
I will be sick again ... and ugly . 
No more complaints about my cooking . 
Don 't worry about me , Mr. Vulcan . 
Interference from the plasma should block us from their sensors . 
Don 't you worry . 
My baby , she ... she 's going to die , isn 't she ? 
I know how stubborn you can be . 
Now it seems kind of sad not , not to leave anybody behind . 
Is he dead , too ? 
Sometimes , you have to go in blind . 
I 'm scared . 
First , you must focus on the object of your fear . 
I was wrong to respond to your communication . 
We often fear what we do not understand . 
She believes you intend to kill her . 
That 's what 's so odd about this . 
Anything more , we 'd be risking serious brain damage . 
I regret very much what has happened to you . 
" The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . " 
You 're the one who ruined my mood . 
You can be so cruel , Harry . 
I 've known fear . 
I don 't see why you 're not having fun . 
Unfortunate as it may be , they 're gone . 
I have been since the moment of the accident . 
Then what 's the problem ? 
Minor damage reported , Deck 14 . 
Can you pinpoint the coordinates of the distress call ? 
Not bad ... for a beginner . 
No fuss , no trouble . 
I 'd hate to lose Baxter . 
He misses his boys terribly . 
It 's a very ineffective way of waging war . 
You want me to kill a child in front of other children . 
ln battle , there are no second chances . 
It appears that Voyager has suffered a ... disaster . 
What 's wrong ? 
There must be something wrong .

Destroy the warp core .

Terribly wrong . 
We don 't want more trouble in our Iives ! 
The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere . 
Call me day or night if this gets any worse .

I have been since the moment of the accident . 
Then what 's the problem ? 
Minor damage reported , Deck 14 . 
There 's no time to worry about blame . 
You 're wrong . 
Nothing to worry about . 
Your parents reaIly forced you to go to the Academy ? 
I 'm hurt pretty bad . 
No , no , that 's where you 're wrong . 
That is an outrageous policy . 
No doubt they wiII attack as soon as Voyager crosses the border . 
Something wrong with your EMH ? 
Can you determine the source of the problem ? 
ShaII I use it on the sick man ? 
Greed is eternal . 
This is an outrage . 
Darkness ... doubt ... hopelessness . 
There is a minor flow problem . 
Then ... it 's dangerous to have them Iiving here . 
You 're asking me to abandon my family , my career ... 
Beam Kes and Neelix directly to Sick Bay . 
Don 't worry . 
I mean no disrespect . 
Everything I went through was meaningless . 
He almost wouldn 't Iet us take her out of Sick Bay . 
Right place ... wrong time . 
Our communicators are useless . 
Pain . 
You should have a black eye or a swoIlen Iip , a broken nose . 
You 'd destroy an entire city ? 
AII three passengers are in Sick Bay . 
That 's an entirely different problem . 
I refused to accept defeat ! 
They give me a terrible rash . 
So tense . 
It 's terrible , isn 't it ? 
From the Iook of them , I 'd say you 're not on the winning side . 
Obviously , they 've never heard of " forgive and forget . " 
And the most vicious Iavaflies you 've ever seen . 
No , just the one in the Mess HaIl . 
It wasn 't Iong before the crew was incapacitated . 
Every time I try to get to the crew , I 'm attacked . 
It 's wrong . 
It 's a death sentence . 
I 'm in Sick Bay ? 
That 's the problem . 
Kal- toh is not about beauty . 
You gave me quite a scare there for a minute . 
My father died over 15 years ago . 
Stop fighting me . 
You 've often expressed frustration with your Klingon temper . 
I knew there was something wrong . 
Do you see any problem with that , Tom ? 
You think she 'II reject me again ? 
She could die from this ? 
You 've seen the ruins ? 
There must be some kind of communications problem . 
We 're responding to a distress caIl . 
I 'm the one who sent the distress caIl . 
The people who attacked you have already puIled it apart . 
So those kind of attacks -- they go on aII the time . 
But you 're right , they 're a problem . 
We can overcome your pain 
There was no crime , no hunger , no health problems . 
What could have been worse ? 
What 's wrong with this thing ? ! 
I 'm tired . 
The carriage is damaged . 
It was their weapons . 
Another patient snatched from the jaws of death . 
I never wanted you to get hurt . 
Don 't worry . 
I doubt we 'II face that problem . 
I wiII attack your ship ! 
Maybe this Iife wouldn 't be so terrible . 
I don 't see what 's so bad about being you . 
TeII them to meet us in Sick Bay . 
Voyager 's under attack . 
They 're prone to violence , they keep you out tiII aII hours . 
That 's much too dangerous . 
No , no . 
So I 'm going to die . 
Mathematics was never your strong point , Father . 
I 'd rather go to prison than help you perpetuate ignorance ! 
Don 't worry , Captain , 
Don 't worry , Captain . 
You 've just threatened the wrong woman , Chakotay . 
I have no doubt the Captain concurs . 
Captain Janeway to betray us . 
Self- destruct sequence has been terminated . 
What 's wrong ? 
If you ask me , a tetryon scan is a waste of time . 
Not bad . 
No , they just complain about it more . 
Now , you 'II drown , too . " 
There 's an ancient Chinese curse , Captain ... 
I don 't think the Captain is an idiot . 
Not bad . 
There is no emergency , Doctor . 
If I see you in here again for an exercise- related injury , 
That 's a long trip home with a damaged collimator . 
I 'd be lying if I said I hadn 't been wondering . 
I would never do anything to hurt him . 
We don 't want to risk general synaptic failure . 
I assume this is where the murder occurred . 
I warned you that you were entering a war zone at your own risk . 
You are our first glimpse into what lies beyond death . 
Ever since the , um ... accident ... 
Beam it directly to Sick Bay . 
They just decay inside those asteroids . 
- Kill him ? 
Study , my ass . 
Prepare to fire on the Klingon war birds . 
All ships destroyed , captain . 
- Further more you have failed to define the purpose of the test 
We 've received a distress call from Vulcan . 
Oh , and you 're gonna get a really bad headache and flop sweat . 
And allowed my people to burn while their planet broke in half . 
Bullshit . 
You realize how unacceptable this is ? 
Coming back in time , changing history , that 's cheating . 
- Kill him ? 
Study , my ass . 
Prepare to fire on the Klingon war birds . 
All ships destroyed , captain . 
- Further more you have failed to define the purpose of the test 
We 've received a distress call from Vulcan .

And allowed my people to burn while their planet broke in half . 
Bullshit . 
You realize how unacceptable this is ? 
Coming back in time , changing history , that 's cheating . 
You were attacked by something . 
You" il get a crack at what killed him . 
- It turned and attacked , doctor . 
There is still one problem , captain . 
No contacts , no objects in any direction . 
We grow annoyed at your foolishness . 
You 're tired , but don 't worry . 
You have to kill him , as you did here before . 
Wrong thinking is punishable . 
They don 't mean to be evil . 
Kodos is dead . 
He 's dead . 
Be a shame if that happened . 
No , I 'm not sure . 
- All weapons to full power . 
Worry not . 
We are beaten . 
- Phasers , fire ! 
I regret that we meet in this way . 
I found it lying right over there . 
Your signal is very weak . 
Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about ... 
Possibly because no one has died , Jim . 
A bit more crude about the shaft , I believe . 
Make them think twice about attacking us . 
- I say we hit them dead on . 
And I 'm sick and tired of your logic . 
And yet two men have died . 
Mr. Spock , you 're a stubborn man . 
Who is this maniac ? 
Come , everyone , let 's forget your bad manners . 
- Does it actually make you angry ? 
I actually experienced genuine rage . 
That 's your problem , Trelane . 
Because you 're a bumbling , inept fool . 
You broke my sword ! 
We 're hopelessly outnumbered here , captain . 
Destroy the Enterprise , and everything is wide open . 
We destroyed invaders as I shall destroy you . 
Don 't you find that painful , captain ? 
I wanna know what killed him . 
He 's dead . 
Or you 'll have to kill me . 
Or whatever it is that 's killing the crewmen . 
- And he blamed you for that ? 
- And when the orbit begins to decay ? 
You ruined me . 
- Block them out . 
None of the ancient evils . 
We mean you no harm . 
You will be obliterated . 
The evil must be destroyed . 
- You are the evil . 
He 's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here . 
Insufficient facts always invites danger , captain . 
I was simply trying to avoid an argument . 
There was the war to end tyranny . 
Your captain will die . 
Now , please don 't kill him . 
Vendikar is attacking . 
- Are these attacks frequent ? 
- Activate the attack units , Sar . 
They fight their war with computers , totally . 
A whole civilisation would be destroyed . 
We 're going to try and stop the killing . 
Guard positions in tunnels eight and ten fail to answer . 
I see I 'm in error . 
Destroy this one , and they 'll all go . 
No vehicles , no weapons . 
He might be in trouble . 
And it explains the murdered men . 
Probably in pain somewhere back there . 
- Negative , captain . 
Kill it , captain , quickly . 
" No kill I. " 
- It 's wounded , badly . 
End disease , hunger , hardship . 
Something was destroyed ? 
Killers . 
I respect you , captain , but ... ... this is war . 
I don 't intend to kill you unless I have to . 
Your weakness , Captain Kirk . 
A shame , captain . 
It could mean trouble . 
Is he the thing that attacked you ? 
Fire ! 
I 'll kill you first . 
Killers ! 
Killers ! 
I 'll kill you first ! 
You were saying you 'll have no trouble explaining it . 
Is that how you 're able to fake all of this ? 
You look terrible . 
Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from . 
He 's delirious , possibly dangerous . 
Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant , captain . 
Wasn 't so bad , was it ? 
Once upon a midnight dreary , While I pondered , weak and weary 
Is she dead , gone , destroyed ? 
Irritating ? 
I can sense mainly worry in you , Jim . 
You fools ! 
It was terrible . 
Six people dead . 
We 've got no business being out here , no business . 
I 've lost patients before , but not like that . 
- He died , didn 't he ? 
Some kind of savage , ferocious opposite . 
His negative side , which you call hostility , lust , violence . 
Thus , shock , induced by blind terror . 
I feel so weak . 
I can understand loneliness . 
A cheat . 
Not a wife to cook and sew ... ... and cry and need . 
Apparently an accident . 
Ruk destroyed them both . 
- No problems here , sir . 
She killed the android , Korby , the same way you killed Ruk . 
" What if they get sick ? 
Dead or alive . 
- No harm to him , sir . 
Oh , no , no . 
- Hate . 
- Die . 
I have no desire to damage my brain . 
Touch the wrong line , and you 're dead . 
If there were a reason , my father is quite capable of killing . 
Mutual suspicion and interplanetary war . 
I just called the Klingon a liar . 
The sick should die . 
And I saw fear in the Klingon 's eye . 
She was prepared to die , Earthman . 
Two convoy ships are already damaged . 
They can only kill me once for touching her . 
Does that mean you prefer to die ? 
I have a right to my weapons . 
Two convoy ships are already damaged . 
You 've got it all wrong . 
I killed them as they slept . 
Look , we know the problem . 
- Did it hurt ? 
After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code 2 . 
- The danger from the Romulans ... 
And he ran out of the building and he was scared to death . 
Sir , they fired another . 
Fire into it immediately ! 
You were attacked by something . 
You 'll get a crack at what killed him . 
- It turned and attacked , doctor . 
There is still one problem , captain . 
But then , he will have lost total resentment toward women . 
Jealousy has often been a motive for murder . 
Three murders , and Scotty the only possible answer each time . 
Unless Scotty 's lying about his loss of memory . 
Were you angry enough to do violence ? 
Not just death . 
But it will die , finally . 
Priority- 1 distress call . 
You told us to avoid trouble . 
A lot of them are dead . 
- Poisoned ? 
Fire ! 
I always thought that was a human failing , Mr. Spock . 
Since your alternative is death . 
- That man 's dead back there . 
I just think your behaviour is arrested . 
Negative . 
Suffer the deaths of thy neighbour , eh , Spock ? 
But at a dangerously low level . 
- Just because the Vulcans failed ... 
Believe a sufficient charge of ... - could destroy the organism . 
A mugato attacked him . 
It brought up evil beasts from my soul . 
We must fight or die . 
And I have the wrong husband . 
Give her to the man who killed the most of her people . 
If I get into any trouble , I 'll quit . 
Who said anything about a fight to the death ? 
We faced a similar crisis in our earlier nuclear age . 
When the struggle came which devastated your planet ... 
Is something wrong , Miss Chapel ? 
You look tired , Miss Chapel . 
You realise that the aim will , of course , be very crude . 
Death to Zeon ! 
We 've got to choose the lesser of two evils . 
It is time to stop the bloodshed , to bury our dead . 
Mr. Spock ... ... you 're sick . 
Rojan , I 'm going to Sickbay , my first officer has taken ill . 
Am I disturbing you ? 
You have told me over and over again humans are no threat to us . 
Enemies ! 
They 'll attack anything that moves . 
As you 've seen , we resemble the Yangs , the savages . 
- Tell me why you want to kill me . 
You 're not gonna stand there and let them kill you . 
It would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided . 
Let your god strike me dead if I lie . 
We don 't want to destroy life . 
Enemy vessels must be neutralised . 
- Must you survive by murder ? 
The Enterprise looks dead . 
I didn 't harm them , Septimus , as much as I wanted to . 
A pity we can 't let him loose in our hospitals . 
I am sorry I was detained . 
No sad faces . 
One wrong move from her and he could kill her . 
Kill a deer ! 
Kill a deer ! 
A father doesn 't destroy his children . 
- She might get killed . 
There must be damage to your instruments , Spock . 
Did I disturb you ? 
Is there a problem , Creator ? 
Besides , what are you feeling so badly about ? 
No damage . 
I hate this thing . 
Mr. Spock has orders to kill you , captain . 
I can 't let him die , Jim . 
No , no , we haven 't met before ... ... exactly . 
They are forbidden by Vaal . 
Vaal has forbidden this . 
- We meant no harm . 
Very bad poetry , captain . 
If we weren 't missing two officers , and a third one dead , 
You 're trying to deceive me . 
- That 's my problem . 
- Something wrong ? 
I want the override broken . 
- That is an outrageous assumption ! 
Then , I am unable to discern your problem . 
I think we 're in a lot of trouble . 
Hit my people at their weakest point ? 
You miserable sot ! 
Your species is self- destructive . 
That is exactly why I hate you , because you are identical . 
Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens . 
He 's dead . 
Scotty 's dead . 
How could I be unhappy ? 
At the moment , we 're helpless . 
I had tools and supplies left over from my crash . 
You 're tired . 
I was almost dead . 
Zefram Cochrane died 150 years ago . 
Then she 'll die . 
It troubles you , Cochrane ? 
You could kill it . 
No doubt about it , Spock . 
- It 's disgusting . 
I don 't want to die . 
Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it . 
But even if you stay here , you 'll eventually die . 
A break in the skin or a cut can be fatal . 
- Don 't worry . 
Parmen first , and they 'll all get infected . 
Not that I 'm afraid or anything , but will it hurt much ? 
Bitter dregs 
Now all I want to do is crawl away and die . 
- You 're the enemy ? 
This won 't kill you , but the stun effect is not very pleasant . 
My reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon . 
Cell damage . 
I see no reason to make him feel any worse than he has to . 
Deela , have your scientists disconnect , destroy that unit . 
- You damaged the transport . 
That was wrong of me . 
- Those are undesirable qualities . 
Now , what about your problem , captain ? 
- Negative . 
Could the strain really have killed her ? 
What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it . 
Stop trying to kill each other , then worry about being friendly . 
An arrogant monster . 
I don 't want everybody to hate me . 
I don 't think they meant to attack us . 
Enterprise , prepare to be boarded or destroyed . 
I want to die with you . 
- Destroyed it ? 
You 're the only woman on this planet , you stupid cow . 
I may kill you with my bare hands ! 
It is in fact exquisitely painful , as you will now see . 
Doctor , they may already be dead . 
Poor , dear , suffering child . 
Garth can destroy us . 
Don 't you usually know whose property you 've stolen ? 
Kill him . 
leading , of course , to death and destruction . 
Kill him ! 
My people , all dead ? 
Give up your hate . 
You both must end up dead if you don 't stop hating . 
How will you know when I am to die ? 
That 's how my arm got hurt . 
Unfortunately , I must violate a direct order from Starfleet . 
- Wrong ? 
Female intruder , extremely dangerous . 
Such evil , and she 's so ... 
We mean no harm to you . 
Destroy it ! 
That bought us the time we needed to destroy it . 
- Was he wrong , Lieutenant ? 
They will kill you . 
Resisting us killed those people . 
- Is there something wrong ? 
Are you troubled now ? 
Here the centuries of loneliness were to end . 
You cannot love an android , captain . 
I can 't afford to guess wrong . 
We mean you no harm . 
We don 't want to hurt anyone . 
We will all die ! 
Trouble . 
Your very presence will destroy the people you seek . 
There is no insanity in what they seek . 
But all kinds of trouble Come to an end 
No , they tried to destroy us . 
Then you are a fool . 
Providing Midro doesn 't kill me , of course . 
Die from something that can 't be seen ? 
They 'll kill each other . 
Ungrateful , vindictive . 
No doubt you have devices which can check my reality . 
No doubt to be followed by Louis of France and Robert the Bruce . 
Gentlemen , if those are weapons , please lower them . 
Our concept of good and evil is strange to them . 
I am disappointed . 
What if they defeat us ? 
- No , it 's not advantage enough . 
No , I speak for myself because I abhor violence . 
No need to blame yourself for its failure . 
I think the wrong gull must have kicked you in the head . 
- No , no , no . 
He is ill . 
Are you trying to tell me that we 're trapped here ? 
I knew there was trouble . 
You don 't really wanna hurt me , do you ? 
What is wrong with me ? 
And you punished and tortured me because of it . 
We 'd have killed each other . 
Now , why didn 't you kill him ? 
You want me to be his murderer . 
My fears are past . 
They want something or they would have destroyed us by now . 
And very badly . 
It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge . 
Then they will leave him dead , or what might be worse than dead . 
I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip . 
Our people are warriors , often savage . 
Drop your weapon . 
Compute enemy course from last position and open fire . 
I will take my place as your prisoner . 
The devil with an asteroid ! 
He died before he told Salish the secret . 
No , Miramanee , there is no one else in my mind or my heart . 
Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone . 
Or fear ? 
And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment . 
- That dirty old planet ? 
I 'm tired too , you know . 
They don 't understand the evil that they 're doing . 
You will be destroyed . 
And that is a grave weakness . 
Carry out your duties or I will destroy you . 
They 're crying , Jim . 
That 's the worst . 
That 's the worst . 
I didn 't lose you . 
Liar ! 
Who is to say whether Kollos is too ugly to bear ? 
You can 't see , and Kollos can 't hurt you . 
I can even tell you how fast your heart is beating . 
There must be no delay . 
Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy . 
- You 're insane . 
Yours shall be the pattern of your death . 
Your problem is , who does Wyatt Earp think you are ? 
- No , no , I haven 't forgotten . 
Billy Claiborne , you are a cattle rustler and a horse thief . 
We fight only when there 's no choice . 
Our warning threats are over . 
Captain , the enemy ship is drifting , totally disabled . 
To start a war ? 
Stop the torture . 
Almost 400 crewmen are trapped down there , sir . 
This is a fight to the death . 
You don 't die yet . 
Sword wounds in the vital organs , massive trauma , shock . 
The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it , captain . 
You 're a dead duck , you 're powerless . 
Weapons , communication devices . 
He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains . 
Didn 't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets ? 
- And the punishment is death ? 
- I will have you put to death . 
- I will see you die ! 
You felt the pain of warning ? 
The Oracle can no longer punish us . 
It 's still negative , Mr. Spock . 
You mean to be sure if he was dead . 
I have a diagnosis of the crewman who attacked Engineer Scott . 
He 's delirious , possibly dangerous . 
We don 't want to destroy life . 
Enemy vessels must be neutralised . 
- Must you survive by murder ? 
The Enterprise looks dead . 
- All weapons to full power . 
Worry not . 
We are beaten . 
- Phasers , fire ! 
I regret that we meet in this way . 
You 're tired , but don 't worry . 
You have to kill him , as you did here before . 
How long can you block your thoughts , a few minutes , an hour ? 
Wrong thinking is punishable . 
They don 't mean to be evil . 
I want to know what killed this man ! 
He 's dead . 
Or you 'll have to kill me . 
Or whatever it is that 's killing the crewmen . 
Don 't let them kill me ! 
Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant , Captain . 
That wasn 't so bad , was it ? 
Destroyed ? 
Irritating ? 
I can sense mainly worry in you , Jim . 
It was terrible . 
Six people dead . 
A woman strangled . 
We 've got no business being out here ... no business . 
I 've lost patients before , but not like that . 
I know you don 't ... you couldn 't ... hurt me ... would you ? 
Some kind of savage , ferocious opposite . 
I feel so weak . 
I can understand loneliness . 
A cheat . 
Apparently an accident . 
I 'm sick of your half- breed interference , do you hear ? 
No problems here , sir . 
Not our problem , Bones . 
Dead or alive . 
No harm to him , sir . 
Tragedy , Doctor . 
No , no . 
Hate . 
Die . 
I have no desire to damage my brain . 
[ Crash ] 
Touch the wrong line , and you 're dead . 
No contacts , no objects in any direction . 
We grow annoyed at your foolishness . 
But don 't worry . 
Kill him as you did before . 
Wrong thinking is punishable . 
They don 't mean to be evil . 
As a prisoner , caged , a zoo specimen , 
Is King Duncan dead ? 
Kodos is dead . 
He 's dead . 
Be a shame if that happened . 
No , I 'm not sure . 
" Your lives means slow death 
By killing seven innocent men . 
Cancel battle stations . 
You 've broken the rule of silence . 
Worry not . 
We are beaten . 
Phasers , fire ! 
I regret that we meet in this way . 
Sir , uh ... our surveys couldn 't have been that wrong . 
Your signal 's weak . 
Dangers we happen to think of -- 
Possibly because no one has died, Jim . 
A bit more crude about the shaft , I believe . 
- I say we hit them dead on . 
I 'm sick and tired of your logic ! 
And yet , two men have died . 
Mr. Spock , you 're a stubborn man . 
Who is this maniac ? 
Let 's forget your bad manners . 
No , no , Mr. Spock , that 's not the reason . 
I actually experienced genuine rage . 
Because you 're a bumbling , inept fool . 
You broke my sword ! 
We 're hopelessly outnumbered here , Captain . 
Destroy the Enterprise , and everything is wide open . 
We destroyed invaders , as I shall destroy you ! 
And he blamed you for that ? 
When the orbit decays ? 
Block them out . 
We mean you no harm . 
You will ... be ... obliterated . 
The evil must be destroyed . 
- Landru , help me ! are the evil . 
He 's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here . 
Insufficient facts always invite danger , Captain . 
I was simply trying to avoid an argument . 
There was the war to end tyranny . 
Now please don 't kill him . 
Are these attacks frequent ? 
Activate the attack units , Sar . 
They fight their war with computers totally . 
A whole civilization would be destroyed . 
We 're going to try and stop the killing . 
Guard positions in tunnels 8 and 10 fail to answer . 
Destroy this one , and they 'll all go . 
No vehicles , no weapons . 
He might be in trouble . 
[ Communicator Whines ] 
And it explains the murdered men . 
Now it 's wounded ... probably in pain somewhere back there . 
Negative , Captain . 
Kill it , Captain , quickly . 
I tried talking to it , but no response . 
It 's wounded -- badly . 
This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture . 
Something was destroyed ? 
I 'll kill you here and now , is that clear ? 
To be killed ? 
A shame , Captain . 
It could mean trouble . 
Is he the thing that attacked you ? 
I 'll kill you first ! 
Killers ! 
Killers ! 
I 'll kill you first ! 
You were saying you 'll have no trouble explaining it . 
Is that how you 're able to fake all of this ? 
You look terrible ! 
Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from . 
He 's delirious and possibly dangerous . 
It is obvious that you have surmised my problem , Doctor . 
If I get into any trouble , I 'll quit . 
Who said anything about a fight to the death ? 
No sad faces . 
" Kill a deer . " 
A father doesn 't destroy his children . 
She might get killed . 
There must be damage to your instruments . 
Did I disturb you ? 
Is there a problem , creator ? 
Besides , what are you feeling so badly about ? 
No damage . 
I hate this thing . 
Mr. Spock has orders to kill you , Captain . 
They are forbidden by Vaal . 
Vaal has forbidden this . 
Poor Matt . 
Very bad poetry , Captain . 
If we weren 't missing two officers ... and a third one dead ... 
It 's my problem . 
Something wrong ? 
I want the override broken . 
Harry Mudd , you 're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble . 
That , sir , is an outrageous assumption . 
Then I 'm unable to discern your problem . 
I think we 're in a lot of trouble . 
Are you going to hit my people at their weakest point ? 
You miserable sot ! 
Your species is self- destructive . 
If you take him to your sick bay , he 'll be repaired ? 
Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens . 
He is dead . 
Scotty 's dead . 
Let us hear it for our poor , dead friend . 
I was sent to Epsilon Canaris 3 to prevent a war , Doctor . 
At the moment , we 're helpless . 
You 're tired . 
I was almost dead . 
I wanted to die in space , that 's all . 
It troubles you , Cochrane ? 
You could kill it . 
It 's disgusting . 
Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it . 
But even if you stay here , you 'll eventually die . 
If there were a reason , my father is quite capable of killing ... 
I just called the Klingon a liar . 
Powders and liquids for the sick ? 
The sick should die . 
She was prepared to die , Earth man . 
Two convoy ships are already damaged . 
They can only kill me once for touching her . 
Does that mean you prefer to die ? 
I have a right to my weapons . 
Two convoy ships are already damaged . 
Pain is here . 
You 've got it all wrong . 
[ Baby Crying ] 
I killed them as they slept . 
We know the problem . 
Did it hurt ? 
After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code 2 . 
Heh heh heh . 
The danger from the Romulans ... 
He was scared to death . 
I 've removed all the breakables from sick bay . 
[ Choking ] 
You were attacked by something . 
You 'll get a crack at what killed him . 
It turned and attacked , Doctor . 
In fact , there was no fault . 
There is still one problem , Captain . 
It 's sickening . 
Jealousy has often been a motive for murder . 
Three murders ... and Scotty the only possible answer each time . 
Unless Scotty 's lying about his loss of memory . 
Were you angry enough to do violence ? 
If you destroy this ship , you destroy yourself . 
You 're going to hurt somebody with that thing . 
Everybody will die . 
But it will die finally . 
How sad for you . 
You told us to avoid trouble . 
Poisoned ? 
Nobody 's hurt , Captain ... yet . 
You 're killing her ! 
[ Baby Cries ] 
Negative . 
Suffer the death of thy neighbor , eh , Spock ? 
But at a dangerously low level . 
Just because the Vulcans failed -- 
It brought up evil beasts from my soul . 
We must fight or die ! 
And I have the wrong husband . 
Give her to the man who killed the most of her people . 
We faced a similar crisis in our early nuclear age . 
When the struggle came which devastated your planet -- 
Is something wrong , Miss Chapel ? 
You look tired , Miss Chapel . 
You realize that the aim will be very crude . 
- Death to Zeon ! 
It is time to stop the bloodshed , to bury our dead . 
Mr. Spock ... you 're sick . 
My first officer 's taken ill . 
Am I disturbing you ? 
You have told me over and over again humans are no threat to us . 
They 'll attack anything that moves . 
As you 've seen , we resemble the Yangs -- the savages . 
Tell me why you want to kill me . 
A nuclear devastation or a bacteriological holocaust . 
We killed thousands , and they still came . 
Let your God strike me dead if I lie . 
We don 't want to destroy life . 
Enemy vessels must be neutralized . 
Take him to sick bay . 
I should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death . 
Must you survive by murder ? 
The Enterprise looks dead . 
I didn 't harm them , Septimus , as much as I wanted to . 
It 's a pity we can 't let him loose in our hospitals . 
I am sorry I was detained . 
We don 't want to hurt anyone . 
We will all die ! 
They want something , or they would have destroyed us by now . 
It 's my ship they want and very badly . 
It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge . 
I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip . 
Often savage . 
Drop your weapon . 
- and open fire ! 
The devil with an asteroid ! 
No , Miramanee , there 's no one else in my mind or my heart . 
Don 't hurt him ! 
Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone . 
Or of fear . 
And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment . 
That dirty old planet ? 
I 'm tired , too , you know . 
Carry out your duties , or I will destroy you ! 
They 're crying , Jim . 
That 's the worst ! 
I didn 't lose you . 
You are blind , and there are some things you simply cannot do . 
I am sorry for the trouble I 've brought to your ship . 
There must be no delay . 
Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy . 
You 're insane ! 
Yours shall be the pattern of your death . 
Your problem is , who does Wyatt Earp think you are ? 
No ... no , I haven 't forgotten . 
Mr. Chekov is dead . 
We fight only when there 's no choice . 
Our warning threats are over . 
What were your orders , to start a war ? 
Almost 400 crewmen are trapped down there , sir . 
This is a fight to the death . 
You don 't die yet . 
Sword wounds in the vital organs , massive trauma , shock -- 
Then get back to sick bay ! 
The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it . 
Didn 't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets ? 
And the punishment is death . 
I 'll have you put to death . 
- Until you are dead , he will think of you and disobey ! 
You felt the pain of warning ? 
The oracle can no longer punish us . 
How bad ? 
It 's still negative , Mr. Spock . 
You mean to be sure if he was dead . 
I have the diagnosis of the crewman who attacked engineer Scott . 
Don 't worry about it . 
It 'll destroy him . 
They 'll all get infected . 
Uh , not that I 'm afraid or anything , but will it hurt much ? 
He 's in Sick Bay . 
You 're the enemy ? 
This won 't kill you , but the stun effect is not very pleasant . 
My reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon . 
Cell damage . 
Why make him feel worse ? 
Deela , have your scientists disconnect , destroy that unit . 
You damaged the transporter . 
That was wrong of me . 
Those are undesirable qualities . 
Now , what about your problem , Captain ? 
Negative . 
Could the strain really have killed her ? 
What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it . 
Will it prevent this catastrophe ? 
I don 't want everybody to hate me . 
I don 't think they meant to attack us . 
I want you to go to Sick Bay . 
It is my time to waste , Ambassador . 
Enterprise , prepare to be boarded or destroyed . 
I want to die with you . 
I destroyed it . 
You 're the only woman on this planet , you stupid cow . 
Doctor , they may already be dead . 
You 're weak , 
Poor , dear , suffering child . 
Garth can destroy us . 
You must shoot , but shoot both of us . 
Don 't you usually know whose property you 've stolen ? 
That will not be satisfactory , not at all satisfactory . 
Kill him ! 
leading , of course , to death and destruction . 
My people , my -- all dead ? 
Give up your hate . 
You both must end up dead if you don 't stop hating . 
How will you know when I am to die ? 
It almost killed me . 
Unfortunately , I must violate a direct order from Starfleet . 
- Wrong ? 
That 's how D 'Amato died ! 
But that raises an even worse question . 
We mean no harm . 
Destroy it ! 
That bought us the time we needed to destroy it . 
Damage report . 
- Was he wrong , Lieutenant ? 
They will kill you . 
Resisting us killed those people . 
Are you troubled now ? 
You cannot love an android , Captain . 
- Are they in the sick bay ? 
Trouble . 
Your very presence will destroy the people you seek . 
There is no insanity in what they seek . 
No , they tried to destroy us . 
Hours can be centuries , Just as words can be lies . 
Then you are a fool . 
Die from something that can 't be seen ? 
- They 'll kill each other . 
No doubt you have devices which can check my reality . 
No doubt to be followed by Louis of France and Robert the Bruce . 
Ye gentlemen , if those are weapons , please lower them . 
Our concept of good and evil is strange to them . 
lam disappointed . 
What if they defeat us ? 
No , it 's not advantage enough . 
But out of our suffering some of us found the discipline to act . 
The first were killed , but others followed . 
No , no , no . 
- He 's a witch ! 
I knew there was trouble . 
You don 't really want to hurt me , do you ? 
What is wrong with me ? 
And you punished and tortured me because of it . 
We 'd have killed each other . 
Why didn 't you kill him ? 
You want me to be his murderer . 
My fears repast . 
So we Can fight together ... the rest is missing . 
Then we 'll have to higher nannies to watCh over the kids at war . 
I 'm sorry , it was a stupid thing to do . 
Too bad . 
- Don 't bloCk the road . 
- Damn it . 
Damn . 
Our terrible Code of Death is gone ! 
Shall we kill him ? 
The Fujibayashi men failed . 
They were killed ... ... because of Takeda 's desire . 
That was dangerous . 
Me and my enemy will die together . 
I watched him die . 
Back off , or you 'll get hurt . 
Don 't be stupid ! 
No , stop ! 
I thought you were dead . 
Not bad 
And when you do , they always manage to kill two or three hounds 
It didn’ t kill me 
Police four hours late at scene of bloody hold- up 
It makes the job easy , but it makes me want to be sick 
No , you condemned them without a hearing 
Gu has got to die

" The bloody hold- up affair " 
Gu has got to die 
- Not bad . 
Don 't worry . 
Not a bad idea . 
BLOODY HOLDUP POLlCE SPRlNG INTO ACTlON 
" Bloody holdup . 
It must kill him to know people think he 'd do that . 
It 's bad . 
Gu must die . 
What a shame . 
Answer me , damn it . 
Murder ! 
He 'd been bludgeoned to death by a board . 
Make a fool out of me ? 
Calver Weems said not to tell anybody he 's dead ... 
I foresee no problems , Nicholas . 
You didn 't do so bad . 
- You wanted him broken . 
How bad is that horse ? 
- The trouble is , we gotta be dead sure . 
- We get it wrong ? 
Am I your prisoner ? 
Trouble ! 
Go to hell . 
And fought for six years , the worst years . 
You bastard ! 
- You wanted him broken .

- They 'll just die . 
Don 't you see you 'll die ? 
I 'm sorry , John , you must have frightened her . 
I 'm going to miss her terribly . 
But that malaria was very bad . 
Poor darling , I 've hurt her feelings . 
You know , you 're as much her prisoner as she is yours . 
You mad , impetuous boy . 
- Tired ? 
How can you be so cruel ? 
What 's wrong with a zoo , anyway ? 
Well , there 's no doubt at all whose kill that is . 
- They 'll just die .

After Meng had killed he found that his wife was dead 
He took his niece and left in grief swearing to take vengeance 
and troubles would not have arisen 
You bastard 
You dirty beggar 
I 'll kill you if you don 't 
I 'm a useless fellow now 
Don 't get angry , I 'll go 
Pay respects to Shengnan 's dead parents 
Then you 've helped her to deceive me 
Although Meng is a devil 
What 's wrong ? 
I 'm guilty of a big crime 
They shot his eye with poisonous arrow 
# And I could die 
I am a loser . 
- Oh , I 'm broke . 
# He may not be the kind you find in picture books 
# Now , don 't you do me wrong 
# He was a loser that night 
I don 't know about you , but I killed 'em . 
My problem is just the other way around . 
I was trying to make you jealous . 
# There 's no reason to be gloomy 
# While there 's music , life 's no waste 
- I want her to be as miserable as I am . 
Jealous enough to ask me to marry him . 
- Oh , she 'd kill me . 
How can I lose ? 
# He was a loser that night 
Please don 't die ! 
# Forget your troubles , forget your strife 
I thought it was the enemy . 
- Not bad . 
I knew you wouldn 't expel them . 
Now , don 't you be discouraged . 
- Drop dead . 
Soon they 'II realize they were wrong . 
Soon they 'II realize they were wrong . 
This may hurt a little . 
Miss Marcus , you shock me . 
You 're evil . 
Oh , no , no . 
You don 't seem to understand our problem .

Enough that some desperate kill you while you sleep . 
I also wonder if you 'll pay for the funeral . 
Four men killed in a shootout . 
- Never get tired of being my conscience ? 
Before God damn you to hell for what you do here . 
He told me he wanted to build a monument to those who died . 
- Do you think they will attack again ? 
The cattle will be lost in the hills and crops will be lost . 
One chance in hell . 
Densuke , what a beating you took . 
But too bad , victory will be ours , the Todoroki Shimada team ... 
Losers , rise ! 
It 's the cry of losers ! 
Sorry for the interruption , Mifune ... 
Well , there 's no arguing with Shima Kurosawa ! 
I will not allow you to hurt Miss Chiharu any longer ! 
lf you can 't find him , you 'll all be dead . 
I was tired of the 500 years of captivity 
We 've to suffer to get the Script . 
Monkey , you can 't kill . 
lf you don 't kill him , he 'll kill you . 
How can you break the rules to kill . 
Bastard , no good deeds from Gao 's . 
It 'd be a shame if this news spreads . 
This little thingy ... just scared me . 
Kill the Demons . 
I 'll do what ever I can to take a revenge . 
I was wrong lyre- born and became a Pig . 
Don 't feel bad . 
There must be something wrong . 
It 's shame on you to be a man . 
They nearly killed me . 
lf I 'm hung up for 3 more days , I will die . 
That Pig is really stupid . 
I am bad- tempered , 
lf you can 't find him , you 'll all be dead .

No problem 
You may suffer losses 
This is our internal problem 
What 's problem ? 
Because you confessed that you did not have confidence in me 
Do you know we 've been suffering for you ? 
Offensively speaking , you 're simply the boss ' stooge 
Who 's the evil creature , old man ? 
Don’ t worry , old man 
The villagers are suffering from the drought 
I 'm not here to give you any trouble 
I 've lived in distress all this time 
I just fear that Sun Wukong might sneak and steal it 
Don’ t you worry 
There 's no need to be scared 
And you killed two lives 
You 're wrong 
You killed again , this is wrong 
Couldn 't just let the master suffer , could I ? 
I 'm starving ! 
If You don 't , sneak in and check on the enemy ! 
You 'll be punished ! 
We meant to ask Sampei but we heard he died . 
We 'd all die ! 
Is thiSour punishment for crossing Your place ? 
If you don 't , I 'll kill you . 
Did they give you much trouble ? 
We 're all gonna die anyway . 
If you don 't , I 'll kill you without mercy . 
After all we are not making the love in this dirty apartment ? 
You are not happy ? 
Don 't try to escape again , next time I kill you . 
Stupid ! 
You masochistic claustrophobic ... 
I almost drowned 
Living in confusion , I 'm so worn out 
She 's been injured ! 
Didn 't you lose a toenail ? 
I want to make one too , but ... one with speed and destruction 
Sad Cat 's got the Bali trip , huh ? 
You had me worried sick ! 
You should have kept lying . 
You 're angry that Mello turned out to be me , a loser , right ? 
Don 't worry ! 
lf our enemies find out , we are lost ! 
How many dead ? 
- Where 's the trombonist ? - ill , Your Highness . 
No subject is more controversial than Fashion . 
What kind of a freak ? 
I have to send you off to your flea- bitten war . 
- That 's a hell of a thing to say right now . 
Some of the British are angels , the rest are bastards . 
Or you 'll be dead .

In marrying your sisters , we 've ruined ourselves . 
Mother hates me .

I did not say we had to murder anyone . 
A man under its influence will do anything , even kill . 
No , no , no , please . 
But you do not think of counterfeiters as criminals . 
Which you will then show to the baron , who will then kill me . 
The only thing they 're arguing about is how and when . 
Still , we are at war here . 
In a way , we 'd hate to lose him . 
A cancer that must be excised at once . 
He suffers from a disease called megalomania . 
There will be an accident . 
No harm would have ever come to him . 
They 'll just kill us now . 
My lying , double- dealing partner . 
We are lying on the coastal shelf at 50 metres . 
It would be foolish to underestimate anybody , Silensky . 
Is something wrong ? 
If Drobbie is still sick next week , don 't bother . 
That hurts . 
Too bad nobody will ever see them . 
I destroyed that roll of film . 
Somebody stole them , passed them on to the enemy . 
This country killed my father . 
She died in 1932 . 
There is no one who can possibly stop us now . 
These pictures could ruin us . 
She was wrong , you know that . 
He 's dead . 
You have an enemy . 
Treason . 
Hurt ? 
- I 'm terribly sorry . 
Otherwise , he 'll kill you , I know it . 
If I try to push this job , I could ruin the plates . 
Tagoor , you have clever hands , but up here , you 're a fool . 
We have wasted enough time . 
Nothing short of outrageous . 
Are you threatening me , Mr. DuBruis ? 
- Let him die . 
To me , whom he fought beside for three long , bloody years . 
An assassination attempt . 
- That his arrest was a mistake . 
It 's a shame . 
The problem is Shipherd . 
And this is your waste- disposal system ? 
If I see him again , I 'll kill him . 
I believe your wife will die . 
The sick cannot enter . 
I expected to put 200 slaves on the block tomorrow . 
Half- starved . 
If I see him again , I 'll kill him . 
Please , you 're making a frightful mistake . 
You must remember , Rollin , I was a bank robber , not a forger . 
- Oh , that 's too bad . 
Robert 's been so worried . 
Get your lousy hands off of me ! 
His leg is broken . 
The only problem I had was making it work silently . 
Yes , they emptied a shotgun at me and killed two of my men . 
I 'm scared to death . 
- Kill him . 
No , he is always isolated from them . 
How will you kill me ? 
Don 't kill him , not tonight . 
You said the rifle was fired while clamped in a vice ? 
No , no . 
- No , no . 
I want him dead . 
Got the wrong guy , honey . 
He 's had a bad night , Mrs. Phelps . 
I 'd say y 'all got some trouble . 
Don 't worry about anything . 
Y 'all having trouble ? 
Could I trouble you to ... ? 
The only thing I 'm sure of , he is a dead man . 
I 'm terribly sorry about your watch , but I did warn you . 
Your problems in the kitchen do not concern me . 
Barret is cold- blooded , ruthless , a killer . 
No , no , it would still be located in the spine . 
You don 't think I 'd intentionally murder you , do you ? 
Destroyed ? 
No , no deals . 
No , no , no . 
Torture ? 
He has since committed suicide . 
It is your claim that Townsend has defected . 
He 's not a brilliant man . 
I told her I would steal the strain for her . 
- The subject is dead . 
If cardiac arrest is the result of brain damage , we 're on ... 
Don 't worry about your chips . 
You have been at the prison for three years , is that correct ? 
Gulka , I shall be leaving the prison for a few hours . 
Of course , you will be in command of the prison . 
Have the two prisoners brought to the main gate . 
Nonsense . 
What we are buying here is death . 
Is anything wrong , Dr. Norris ? 
- No arrest until I order it . 
- No , no , nothing important . 
He 's going to destroy you . 
Lying will not help you now . 
And he forced you to flee with him ? 
He is to talk to no one , see no one . 
Something terrible was happening . 
We have your two associates in prison . 
There can be no further doubt that she is Celine . 
There 's no doubt of it . 
You know , considering our problem with the cordite , 
- The charge is treason . 
- Now you 're cheating , Ivan . 
Killing him is not gonna prove anything . 
It 's the heavy outer mechanical hatch which could be trouble . 
Too bad Carlotta Kleve didn 't have one . 
Skarbeck covered it very well , but he murdered Carlotta Kleve . 
Everything is dangerous . 
Such rules are made to be broken . 
She called me a fool . 
If she cheated on you , I understand why . 
Stop it , stop it . 
" Lobinsk Prison . " 
He 's going to kill me . 
Somebody else fights for me ? 
Killer instinct . 
He must have got cut up in that accident . 
Johnson 's a loser . 
Shake hands , come out fighting at the bell . 
But if anything goes wrong ... 
Well , all we have to do now is make Parma mad enough to kill me . 
A monstrous liar , a traitor and a murderer . 
The lighting is wrong , seсora . 
- Terribly sorry about this . 
No closed- door meetings , no panic sessions . 
It 's disgusting and difficult to deal with . 
They can be dangerous , you know . 
But what harm does he do ? 
- The war for men 's minds . 
It was those fool guards with their dogs .

Jim , we 're in trouble . 
- Charlie , it 's killing me ! 
Now look , nobody 's going to hurt you , all right ? 
The prisoner is dying .

The problem is Shipherd . 
And this is your waste- disposal system ?

Are you mad ? 
We are ... terribly ... busy !

I could kill you , here and now . 
I see no reason to detain you further . 
Your man is in danger . 
Kill him ? 
It 's gonna be a bloody one . 
[ Sobs ] 
No , certainly not , but I do respect him . 
It could damage our controls . 
Father , you 're hurting me . 
They must have tried and failed . 
We can 't just leave 'em here to die . 
Poor Henderson . 
Poor devils . 
- Crude ? 
That is a criticism of our system , Biraki .

It occurs to me now you may even know whether I will die tonight . 
We can 't just sit here and let Doug and Tony be killed . 
Give a warning on the intercom ! 
There will be no more talk of rebellion now .

We could lose them at any time . 
If I go back there , they will kill me . 
- Boudaire , your coming here was an accident . 
Is escape from Devil 's Island possible ? 
We can 't let him die . 
Stop in your tracks , or you are a dead man . 
There 's your revenge . 
Only a fool would not . 
Bad sprain , maybe . 
Too much imagination - That 's your trouble . 
- And what about weapons ? 
You think I should die , don 't you ? 
You could get hurt . 
It 's a lousy trick . 
And how all hearts are stricken with terror before him . 
I want to see if anything goes wrong . 
How could you betray me ? 
He told Yuko that you were ill and he had to go home . 
No , no need to apologize . 
- A time bomb ? 
- You admit he intends to kill the president ? 
- Jeremiah says killing Lincoln is right . 
No , no , no .

Are you trying to ruin my military career ? 
- kill him . 
War brings war . 
Two equal weapons . 
You 're the enemy ! 
Otherwise , I intend to kill you . 
But he was quite helpless at the end . 
Asia , Europe - All will be crushed with my Mongols . 
You disappoint me . 
I was - - It 's no one 's fault , Ann . 
You fool ! 
Or in war ? 
We might not be able to hold off another assault . 
Now we can lose both of them . 
It 's certain death . 
We can shift them in spite of you . 
I think he 's badly hurt . 
Worry about yourself . 
Vikings attacking Vikings . 
So your father 's men attack . 
Are you two - For all we know , they could be poison . 
That wasn 't so bad , was it ? 
Nothing to harm you , of course . 
- You were dishonest with me . 
Don 't worry . 
Killed one of our guards . 
' Cause I don 't like to see anybody murdered . 
Ann , does your research give you the names of the men he killed ? 
That I killed him . 
I always figured a man oughtn 't to die with a lie in his mouth . 
I was dead ? 
Another move like that , and you 're dead . 
He still denies it . 
Only trouble is they haven 't been born yet . 
Well , I got a special punishment for thieves . 
And I 'm not very brave . 
He died 200 years ago . 
You don 't want to hurt me . 
Hampton , this boy has been hurt . 
You 're hurt . 
Then the bomb is probably timed to go off around 3 : 00 a . m . 
Ann , we 're losing it ! 
- No man has a right to kill . 
I would rather be killed quickly than left here alone . 
What does that miserable little skirmish have to do with you ? 
Of all the cheek - How dare you threaten me ! 
He 's a walking dead man . 
He 's a walking dead man . 
General , we 're in trouble . 
- You don 't have to worry about that . 
They 're not built to take this kind of punishment . 
It occurs to me now you may even know whether I will die tonight . 
Hell know what to bring . 
Were supposed to take prisoners to him there . 
The fort is doomed . 
Men who will die without medical attention . 
- Total defeat ? 
Dead ? 
You call us savages . 
Excuse me , sir , but I think youre making a grave mistake . 
How do you want him killed ? 
You feel the only way to prevent it is to attack tonight ? 
- That would be a terrible thing to happen , sir . 
Why , the threat of an uprising is over , and Hira Singh is dead . 
Theyil probably torture him . 
Ill do anything I can . 
And put the gun down ! 
I 'm tired . 
He is ugly . 
Not bad .

There ain 't no crazy gunslingers around here . 
They 're gonna get him , dead or alive . 
- We want him dead . 
The stink in this town . 
They want any more rifles , they 'll have to kill me . 
You keep an eye on the prisoner . 
I 've never seen him that mad before . 
He 's gonna hear her screaming her head off ! 
Tell me he isn 't dead ! 
- The torture ? 
I rarely have fun , Madame . 
You disappoint me . 
Let me go , you fool ! 
She was stolen from me and the King didn 't even replace her ! 
Because of my failure I was revoked . 
This is very sad news to me .

The wretched aristo 's the wrong way round . 
- He abducted the Duc de Pommfrit ? 
No wonder she reeked of tobacco ! 
I mean you no harm . 
It 's too dangerous . 
My blood 's on fire , my heart 's on fire ... 
Oh , how can I betray him to Cammie ? 
Don 't kill him !

Is it a threat ? 
He 'll say that his brother passed away from an illness . 
Should I content myself with such a pathetic fief ? 
Even if Oshi 's vassals attack 
Don 't you know that his wife killed herself ? 
Is it a threat ? 
Fool ! \ xCCy Iord ! \ xD5 ou 've got nothing to do here . 
He 's a coward . \ xCA yonosuke !

You come back to us in trouble ... and in pain . 
Strayhorn died in the swamp .

-- I mean , we announce these idiot polls on the air . 
I have absolutely no problem with that . 
-- No problem , no way , no how . 
Do you think I think you taking your panties off is a bad idea ? 
Don 't worry . 
Am I in trouble ? 
Will , you 've got " H- O- R- S , " which is sad . 
As a last resort , as a worst- case scenario . 
-- I 'm just wondering -- and don 't get mad -- -- What ? 
In the meantime , stay out of trouble , Louise . 
Oh , I rub that in , don 't you worry , sir . 
Look at you now , you wreck . 
And , Miss Perry , I don 't want to be disturbed . 
It ruins everything . 
You 're too overcome with grief and shock . 
Not being big and ugly and all that . 
Shall I cry ? 
Chasing criminals day after day ... 
The enemy 's waiting . 
Damn them . 
Yamatone saw you through and you failed . 
Jackal , use the flying sub to destroy the Golden Bat . 
We can still destroy Icarus . 
What 's wrong ? 
Comes crying to me : 
- Shut your mouth , you bitch ! 
I 'm getting pissed off . 
Assholes ! 
You 're looking at me as if I was an evil criminal ! 
- You 're wrong , it 's ten ! 
It 's rather an unfortunate moment of the day to ask . 
Know the term " gentleman thief " ? 
I swear I 've never seen a more beautiful person in my life ! 
But I gave it to a poor widow . 
Last time you really looked bad . 
- I put out my arm and pretended you were lying beside me ! 
You see , I can scare you just by frowning a little . 
You should be ashamed of yourself . 
You 're all off your bloody rockers ! 
Don 't you worry about that bull . 
I 'll kill Burnett . 
Mother , if that butcher bids , I 'll die . 
Don 't you dare kick a helpless animal . 
Now , les be on our way before you cause more trouble . 
Now , Miss Hilary , don 't start dreaming up any more trouble . 
Burnett had no intention of stopping at Sand Creek .

A disgrace ! 
- They will be wrong . 
Stealing cars from criminals to sell to other criminals ?

We 're wasting time , Jose . 
I trapped one last week . 
Not bad , not bad at all . 
What 's wrong ? 
Not bad . 
- " Look , you 're choking . 
Some old fool got hold of it 's my birthday . 
Here 's my bad little girl . 
- That 's probably why he 's so sore . 
I hate to hurt his feelings . 
You are in a cruel , teasing mood and I don 't understand .

For years , I 've watched you fool with every man and boy ... 
Which is what Alva died of .

Now , that ain 't gonna hurt you , is it ? 
You are in a cruel , teasin ' mood , and I don 't understand . 
There 's a depression . 
- Lying under false colors ? 
- Liar . 
Well ... you know I 'm married , Alva , but I 'm a lonesome man . 
That 's what Alva died of . 
You 're so nervous 
But I 'm so lonely ... 
She tells he is a fool . 
I can see and destroy absolutely anything . 
If you fail , it 's your couple which will be destroyed . 
They will never succeed ! 
I succeeded in making him kill his pal , after the trap minute . 
He 's dead . 
Rotten yourself ! 
Damn it , how often have I told you not to put it there ? 
One sad song is enough to go round the world 
Sure , but don 't cry your eyes out 
And what about the people , did they cry ? 
Where it hurts most

Will such a dire thing happen ? 
No , you will cause our people trouble if you fight now ! 
They killed Father , took Brother and there 's no news of Juro . 
Kill Juro and him too ! 
Fool ! 
But that 's the only thing in the whole world that frightens her . 
Fools ! 
No , I have not had that honor , sir . 
You fool ! 
It must be the wind , the storm outside 's getting worse . 
Still you 're very old , you may die before long . 
I beg of you , be my prisoner . 
Get out here , you lazy bones ! 
It 's a matter of life and death . 
Unless I find Kay , he 'll die . 
He will die if I don 't . 
You there , what are you so sad about ? 
No , don 't cry . 
I no longer know eitherjoy or sadness . 
Kay , why are you acting so foolishly ? 
The Snow Queen has been made a fool of ! 
Those are the enemies foot soldiers ! 
He wilfully misleads you and speaks bad of me behind my back . 
Yet with the most serious problems a woman is powerless . 
Which problems ? 
And if he wants war with Assyria , he 'll wage it . 
Phoenicia would expel me , and our Gods would destroy me . 
Egypt and Assyria will ruin themselves while enriching Phoenicia . 
I hate you ! 
Why have they managed to do that , in spite of their lapses ? 
They will fear Osiris ! 
When you cannot betray , you are a liar , an imbecile , Mefres ! 
The worst disaster is the arrogance of the priests !

No sightings , no distress signals , sir . 
But what a catastrophe , Comrade Chairman . 
And now you will pay the penalty . 
- No , he was dead when I found him . 
There is beauty , there is ugliness , and there is death . 
Makes me feel sad for the rest 
- The loser takes the money . 
Ugly mugs . 
You will either meet me again , or you 'll meet the devil . 
- An abandoned village . 
I 'll provide every one of you with a different death . 
- Don 't waste any lead , Angel Face . 
It 's a risk , but risks are part of the game . 
Drop the gun ! 
It 's outrageous . 
The poor major . 
And they shy away from losers . 
Not bad . 
Pity is the real empty room I despise . 
If anything happens to me ... ... kill him . 
I hate to see loose guns lying around . 
No herd , no Kelly . 
Only problem is where to rebuild it . 
- Mrs. Emberday suffers a lot ... from these tourists . 
I will attend this funeral tomorrow . 
It 's outrageous . 
She was drowned , right ? 
Poor girl , how terrible ! 
Wasn 't that the nervous guy at funeral yesterday ? 
That role I was forced into forever . 
The girl is killed in her bathroom and nobody notices anything . 
You and these stupid Emberday- chicks . 
The life of police men must very depressing . 
I don 't mind killing a police man .

There 's no mistaking it . 
But it will make the history books for being stolen ! 
- What 's wrong ? 
He killed himself . 
After sending me to keep your late lamented husband company ! 
Commissioner , as you have seen there are no doubts ... 
A disagreeable misunderstanding , Mr. Boss . 
Rather , pay attention to the crazy one . 
What 's wrong , Raus ? 
Get that coward Alex if you want the GrisbÌ . 
I 'm an idiot . 
- It 's one of my failings . 
- He bought it just before he died . 
Officer Howard , I 'd hate to wait in that long bloody line . 
- It must hurt you so . 
It 's the same problem . 
Take the rest of that goddamned thing off . 
Mark was frightened . 
Physical torture ? 
Murder one . 
Hell of a shot . 
You took a hell of a chance hiring me . 
" Clairefons died in the tradition . " 
- Then the criticism of you is valid . 
And you got beaten up by gunners ? 
They 're more dangerous than thugs and murderers . 
Torture ! 
You could get into trouble . 
I didn 't know you handcuffed prisoners of war , Colonel . 
We 've disposed of the last bomb . 
They 've killed hundreds of men 
- Let him die 
It would hurt my feelings 
You 're so dumb ! 
It would drive anyone mad 
That 's bad in law 
" It was what was found after I died " 
" The stars would wonder what is wrong " 
lnspector Daljit Singh arrested you from the hills of Lalgarh 
You 're so shameless ! 
Maybe the diary was stolen ... 
So you forced me ? 
A killer ! 
Let me go ... but please don 't kill him don 't kill him ! 
My husband thinks I 'm a fake 
When I was about to kill myself ... 
My enemies are after me 
But the prince was killed . 
I can 't afford to lose ! 
But the prince was killed . 
I can 't afford to lose ! 
You just need to be a living corpse . 
Please , don 't cry , don 't cry . 
Many of them will be arrested , and some will be forced to talk . 
They 're even more dangerous . 
Unless I 'm wrong , I think I asked if you wanted another cognac . 
But then I must go , or else Ingrid will be mad at me . 
No , no , no , it 's on me . 
Dead ! 
I have to get in position to attack ! 
What 's wrong with us , McLane ? ! 
They 've trapped us ! 
After they kick in our front door and kill MZ4 's crew ? ! 
I don 't know how to fix the crappy thing ! 
You were going to destroy us ? ! 
Emergency call from starship Hydra ! 
The government is desperately waiting for suggestions ! 
Let 's stick with destroying the control station ! 
Too bad 
Sometimes I hate my job . 
No I am Hamlet 's ghost . 
- That 's fraud . 
- Ugh , it 's raining . 
Are you scared ? 
Have they been destroyed ? 
And to prevent further damage , the robots took command . 
I can see that you 're making me your scapegoat . 
If I 'm wrong , we 'll all be wasted . 
You didn 't expect all that trouble because of McLane , did you ? 
You 're fools . 
What a poor consolation coming from you ! 
Don 't interrupt ! 
It 's no use suspecting one another for things we can 't explain . 
Left over rebels from the first galactic war . 
- Who spell disaster for us . 
Sadly no . 
- She 's been arrested . 
You must have suffered . 
Still , it 's a pity that we 've fought so often . 
A waste of time . 
- Arrogant whelp . 
Don 't be jealous ! 
Are you hurt ? 
Notorious and famous people . 
Damned swine ! 
- Where did you get weapons ? 
- Dirty swine ! 
So you 'll experience your death twice . 
No more horror stories ! 
I 'd rather die . 
Attack the ship - now ! 
Involuntary criminals . 
Nonsense ! 
- Misconduct ... that saved us from being killed or brainwashed . 
I only fear we might not be able to see him

My poor family 
The Court is rife with intrigue since you fell ill 
All your Eminence 's work could be destroyed in a few weeks 
I was grieved to learn that His Eminence is at death 's door 
You hated him 
I fear his death may mean a return to chaos 
I fear the Cardinal 's death ... 
I command the Court to observe full mourning 
Full mourning 
Sire , I cannot express my gratitude ... 
What a rotten place

You seem sad . 
Don 't lose your head . 
Be careful , Sire , that expenses do not become great . 
You scared me . 
How is life in prison ? 
Poor kid ... 
Did you see him before he died ? 
Damn it ... 
He 's fighting like a killer . 
That 's what they do when they want to kill boxers ! 
Your fate might be worse than mine . 
Then you got me wrong . 
I decided to be stupid . 
A fourth doesn 't scare me . 
I don 't want to die . 
In the sad running 
Passes from death to another death . 
Hell , what a hard work . 
I don 't know , sister Misery , and you , sister Avarizia ? 
These dirty beasts ! 
How stupid ! 
Thus , the dirty man can wash himself . 
Come , my son , don 't discouraged yourself .

You 'll only get yourself killed . 
Kill me instead , you surely hate me ... 
Something exciting , with fights , violence , rape , you know . 
This stolen suitcase story doesn 't work and it gets us nowhere . 
It wasn 't bad . 
Your gun is empty . 
Jean checks , and his gun is empty . 
Well , I lost the first round but the fight is not over 
The world is full of sorrow 
No , not till the old debt is settled 
Your whole gang beaten by a little girl 
He didn 't look like a kung- fu ace 
I 'll have him arrested again 
You 're on the verge of death yet still middle in others affairs 
What the hell are you three doing here ? 
Don 't have a bias ... for those 3 ugly beasts . 
We 'll all die together ! 
What the hell is this ? 
No wife , no children . 
No problem . 
I have no HK dollars so I leave 5 Euro for you . 
What the hell ? 
No problem . 
Don 't leave your own underwear lying around . 
But many cheaters look decent . 
It 's so difficult . 
Don 't worry . 
But I wasn 't scared . 
Wrong word . 
- Everyone 's tired ! 
You 're angry ? 
This is disgusting ... 
That 's disgusting ! 
I 'm jealous ! 
I know I 'm worse than her . 
You 've got the wrong person ... 
Can never trust a hot guy ... 
What a poor guy ... 
I 'll probably die this time .

The Tartar soldiers will attack us ? 
You killed this man ? 
You have killed so you must pay with your life ! 
And no new guests without our approval ! 
If not for him we would be dead by now . 
And also ... don 't be angry ... 
Drop your weapon ! 
Then you will suffer . 
Don 't worry about it . 
But when they tell you it 's an insult .

Too bad I 'll never get the chance to give Wilma this present . 
I don 't want my house to have a bad name ! 
A girl comes on to someone she does not love . 
I 'm suffering too . 
Let them scream another week ! 
I don 't want to disappoint him ! 
- Don 't you fear being seen ? 
Don 't worry ! 
Woe betide those who come between man and wife ! 
I wanted to prove to you that you did me an injustice . 
No . . . no , Miss Annie ! 
Mr. Alexiou , what you did was shameful ! 
The ass ! 
Oh . . . don 't worry ! 
Disaster ! 
The problem has become an academic question . 
My one uncertainty was whether it would be for good or for evil . 
Yours dead , too ? 
I knew Curt wouldn 't panic . 
It will be a forced march . 
And I also believe you 're an accessory to murder ! 
No , you 're not very convincing . 
I want it to be so difficult you just can 't do it ! 
He 's hiding in a cave , forcing humans to do his rotten work . 
Destroyed the thing that was tryin ' to control me ? 
Go ahead and kill me . 
He 's been playing you for a sucker ! 
They will all die with me . 
And you 're trying to destroy it . 
So you have to kill her , no ?

A girI by the name of Melinda Sawyer 's been murdered . 
But since you know the family of the murdered girl -- 
Nonsense . 
But you 're dead . 
So he drank champagne after the murder . 
It 'd be rude to awaken the neighbors . 
What 's wrong with me ? 
-- in 1 08 and he 's reaIly the wickedest of the Iot . 
I feel weak from shock and loss of blood . 
You 're mad , utterly mad . 
The whole thing was too awful , Papa . 
Either you leave this table or I start screaming . 
Is it those police that worry you so ? 
Are we planning the same sort of crime ? 
I 've never been engaged to such a fidgety girl in all my life . 
Offering to become a receiver of stolen goods . 
Simon , isn 't it too awful ?

- It 's just that he could be dead drunk . 
I guess Eb didn 't want him as bad as he thought he did . 
I heard you 're trying to find out who murdered your brother . 
They were both dead enough . 
What 's wrong with Naosuke ? 
Ill got , ill spent . 
Poor fellow . 
I feel so sad . 
I hate to hurt your feelings ... 
He 's depressed every day . 
Fool ! 
A mere girl , but her obsession is overwhelming ... 
If your wife 's face becomes ugly ... 
Is it really painful ? 
Poor baby . 
In a vault , it 's useless . 
Look for her in hell ! 
Once we 're powerful , no one will dare curse us . 
Oh , horrible obsession ! 
No and no ! 
If you kill me , receive 150 dollars . 
Damn ! 
And I , as a poor , I worry for you .

It 's not a pleasure .

A German guy and you were climbing this slope before the war ! 
I 'm tired . 
We can 't risk what he knows getting over to the enemy . 
- Dead ? 
No doubt about it .

- I 'm scared . 
- Don 't worry , captain . 
And the devil walks with us . 
You want me to bomb Orly ? 
And I don 't feel ashamed for what I did . 
But your plan is stupid . 
For boxing , women are even worst than alcohol . 
Never be a prisoner ! 
You were a fellouze during the war , right ? 
The problem is Merignac , the civilian radar . 
I could kill you now . 
Do anything stupid , I 'll kill him and come back for you .

" We never heard that kind before , let 's try it . " 
- Have the pains started already ? 
But I was wrong . 
He will kill you . 
I 'd say the ceremony was one whereby he fell out of sin .

Who was this fellow I killed ? 
He gets mad , he 's not so good . 
Range war . 
- I 'd hate to try and stop him .

What have I done to outrage you ? 
The fighting at Tobruk is nothing compared to the coming battle . 
" Model driver in hit and run accident " 
The payment for damages for example . 
I don 't think there 'll be any problems later . 
That 's no problem . 
And then I 'll kill whoever ran over Takeshi with my own hands . 
When I saw her I thought : this is the person who killed Takeshi . 
The boiler is dangerous , so let me handle that . 
Because it 's dangerous . 
What 's wrong mama ? 
She left a suicide note .

Lord Kamio , doesn 't the shogunate 's weakness concern you ? 
He 's rotten ! 
No mistake about it . 
What if he becomes worse and dies ? 
But it 's too cruel , too brutal !

I figured it must be a gambling joint just for blind folk . 
Step outside , you blind dog ! 
You 've got me all wrong . 
You sons of bitches . 
I 've met a lot of evil sons of bitches in my time , 
If I stuck around any longer , I 'd probably lose it all .

You 're lying when you say that you do not work for DigiCorp . 
You 're gonna kill me ? 
But if Rooks has gone through all this trouble to get it , 
- I don 't want to hear anymore lies ! 
- I can 't believe I was such a fool . 
You said it was the only way to steal the data from the Vault . 
- It 's nonsense ! 
- No gas - You dick ! 
A living death 
But they say when vampires attack someone ... 
Was I supposed to think you were murdered or something ? 
Hey , you got me wrong . 
Seal , you 're doing it all wrong . 
I know what I did wrong . 
A fool ! 
These sharks have no shame . 
And maybe I 'll never get rich . 
It 's suspiciously quiet ! 
You think it is so unimportant ? 
We can stop thinking about death . 
- You 're the one who is stupid ! 
Tochilin , you 're absolutely wrong . 
- You are stupid , aren 't you . 
- Her grades were a disaster . 
It 's blind- man 's buff , you know . 
- I was sick and tired of him .

Dirty pig . 
Don 't annoy the tourist . 
And I will expose your ignominy , your lies , your hopelessness .

I 've basically exchanged one prison for another . 
Are you pursued by unhappiness ? 
But unfortunately I lost the final . 
Bastard . 
Useless . 
Such a tease , but you leave me no choice . 
It 's bad . 
He 's wasting my time 
This bastard will have ... a hard time with me 
The 3rd one is ... both are evil 
What a bastard ! 
You 're always useless 
No problem 
It pissed all over me 
I didn 't think it was much of a problem 
Don 't cry 
You 're bad . 
Don 't lose your temper .

Lt. Colonel Ida Our plan was to continue the war ! 
Have they grown tired of war ? 
Then the Minister of War will be returning here , will he not ? 
So Ichigayadai 's officers are all going to commit suicide . 
Will it preserve our nation , or destroy it ? 
" Let not a single soldier commit a rash or blind act . " 
The final Attack Squadron , 
In that case , I see no problem with taking custody of it . 
The Minister of War will be coming as scheduled , correct ? 
Killing gutless worms like you will only rust my sword .

How could they end the war ? !

The A- bomb is a paper tiger 
You worry me . 
I hate how you discuss things you ignore . 
But when L 'Humanite does , it 's disgusting . 
So , as Veronique 's big enemy , Malraux says , 
- Isn 't it terrorism ? 
Maybe they killed the minister . 
Does it hurt ? 
There ia also the Moscow 's criticism . 
The A- bomb is the paper tiger .

Seven people were killed at Evreux junction last Sunday 
I thought he was dead , for a moment 
Monique said there was only whisky and some vile red wine 
When I came the egg broke and ran down my legs 
Without me and my tractor the French would starve 
Paul is dead ! 
I bet the old bitch will have altered his will . 
We 'll find an accident on the way back and set fire to the lot

By asking 6000 you waste your time and make me waste mine . 
To have you thrown in prison ! 
An arrangement with a thief ! 
And that 's so bad . 
Anyway , I fired her . 
What a stupid question . 
Things are rather bad . 
- That 's true , but don 't worry ! 
You could have told me , you idiot ! 
I 'll be damned ! 
Now my life is meaningless . 
- Don 't worry about my yelling . 
To them , he 's the worst bad guy . 
Look , don 't worry .

[ Sobs ] 
Wislawa 's unstaring eyes frightened me . 
Why does man force another human being to live in absolute pain ? 
- A mass for the dead ? 
And now I 'm going to kill you . 
That I don 't hate Russians ? 
You 're going to get yourself killed for a stupid typewriter . 
Karol , we are starving here . 
I don 't want my child born in this horror . 
So they can be driven to violence and self- destruction . 
The people are starving . 
It 's no fun seeing your own mother so sad and lonely . 
We were in a dark room , hanging on between life and death . 
Shout out your refusal of violence . 
I could live here until the day I die . 
They are trying to hurt us . 
That 's exactly what I feared , Karol . 
You entered the devil 's house and you negotiated with him . 
I denounce every form of clerical mentality as an error . 
Unhappiness doesn 't follow the calendar . 
To stifle it is a crime . 
I 'm frightened . 
For me the word is both vague and misleading . 
Such a sick word . 
The pain inside you , and your anger , are your soul . 
Everybody talks about that scandal . 
He wants me to think I 'm mad . 
We 're in mourning here . 
Don 't be so sad . 
Listen , I 'm terrified . 
I don 't stand a chance in hell against Oldeman . 
Sorrow 's man took him away and tortured him to death . 
What a shame . 
What 's wrong with you ? 
- Who got killed . 
Anything wrong with you ? 
Harry Long has no criminal record . 
But no criminal record . 
I 'll cry ! 
I haven 't done anything wrong , Mr. Johnson . 
You were to be killed , Mr. Johnson . 
I can 't die , I don 't want to die . 
These are frightful times . 
There she is , lying at my feet , awaiting her fate . 
You 're trembling ! 
She 's burned to death ! 
Why , the little hussy , you 're warm , child of the bitch ! 
Where 's that little old man who has been suffering in vain ? 
They killed him ... 
No , no , no , it 's not true ... 
Black- faced Bao , this is your doomsday . 
I just worry that you 'll become cat food . 
Zhan Zhao didn 't do anything wrong . 
Stop bragging , I 'll pay you for the damages . 
This is ridiculous ! 
The stove is missing , the maids are dead . 
Are you going to kill me ? 
I wouldn 't be here if I 'm scared . 
Move the dead bodies . 
So you were the murderer .

If I lose one camellia , I 'll fire him .

- Not bad . 
You 're gonna get sick , really sick , if you keep that up . 
Unethical . 
All right , you sanctimonious bastard . 
Stop bothering her .

- Guy , is terribly late . 
You 're shipping me off like some convict to Devil 's Island . 
Is shocking , the indignities a man must suffer . 
Do you realize I 'm in big trouble already ? 
- Oh , Guy , I 'm scared . 
- In all that water ? - ill put us two hours out of Amsterdam . 
Look , I 'm in trouble .

That 's the trouble with Ruth . 
I hated lying to her though . 
Your memory isn 't bad either . 
[ Chokes ] 
It might hurt their feelings . 
You lose an awful lot of them that way . 
You 're wrong , Ed . 
- [ Baby Crying ] 
Shocking . 
But don 't worry , honey . 
And punish me with the graveyard cold . 
Didn 't you understand yet that you 'd never win over me ? 
A coward , he has no enemies . 
Making a cross with bloody hands of crime . 
All that we just repeat in vain 
You killed Mutsal . 
But the thief will die some day , too . 
Why , in contempt of the old law , You 've put me to such shame ? 
Oh , fool , just stop your blabber . 
Death on the battlefield is fitting

No discomfort ?

And how is your poor sister ? 
Is Mr West , he 's ... ( Sobs ) 
No , no , you misunderstand me , madam . 
You see , I 'm so terribly ignorant of these facts . 
Don 't you worry , sir , I 'll track her down . 
They 're just ignorant fools .

But don 't get me wrong .

Am I only a meaningless , faceless stranger to you ? 
What , on pain of death ? 
Are you frightened ? 
Isn 't that the house where my father ... and sister died ?

Old man ... you always look dumb . 
You betrayed us . 
You foxy Sand ... trying to fool us .

When the Father passed away , was he in pain ? 
- Any of them have a criminal record ? 
Then the market crashed and he went bankrupt . 
Then lnspector Lau must know you 're really scared . 
- Where do we go when we die ? 
We can talk about revenge later . 
Interrogate them and kill them after 
Since he died his wife took over 
Last year we lost the war with the Japanese 
It 's too bad that he is not at home 
Stupid , all of them are idiots

We sold lots of illegal salt 
But we are carrying a dead person 
Aim your secret weapons at me 
In loneliness I waited in vain

Not a single evil thought would flash our mind

He 's Shi Gan , nicknamed No Fear 
Before Mr. Li encountered such a disaster 
You must be tired , and you 've to travel tomorrow

Excuse me , but there 's a casualty in Fosdick . 
I hear you have a casualty for me . 
I did , but you frightened me out of it . 
I 'm in agony . 
Only a man with an injured back . 
What 's the problem ? 
Is it my fault the labour couldn 't find me a job ? 
Not bad .

A little help for the poor blind man ...

It 's useless , we 'll be crushed . 
Even in the face of death ! 
I had to confront cynicism , corruption . 
Always feeble and terrified ! 
A man has been killed . 
Charity only postpones or worsens poverty . 
I prefer Porfirio Diaz insanity ... 
And I continued the struggle , raising banners , never for pride . 
War and wars in foreign countries . 
I 've been writing about the misery of our souls ... 
I can 't die ! 
I walk and see these skinny , apathetic , depressed people . 
What does your death prove ?

A dangerous game . 
It 's plain dumbness . 
Not bad . 
I 'd be in sorrow , each day more . 
She exaggerates , she thinks I 'm a dumb- ass . 
It 's my fault , I 've loved her , I 'm the one who killed her ! 
I guess I 'm more tense than I thought . 
Am I going to die ? 
I 'm frightened to die , man . 
It 's a simple failure . 
How annoying . 
Article 15 , failure to stop at lights . 
I yelled at it to stop and it stopped . 
My grandfather thought the phonograph hated him .

If required , you 'll have to take pains of coming to the station 
But , from few days one of my crafts man has fallen sick - 
Because , I cannot trust upon a new person 
I am scared , if the police is chasing us 
Till I am in his clutches I have to be scared .

They say it is too dangerous to go any further .

The situation hasn 't yet been classified as dangerous . 
For now , we 'll concentrate on the source of the problem . 
Signal for a weapons test on that cluster . 
Something wrong d 'you think ? 
Very vain female . 
Her uncle was took bad , doctor was sent for . 
Not that there 'd be any shame in it if I were .

Now her poor heart has burst 
Now that I 'm at my most helpless , you 're going away . 
War booty . 
It 's an island inhabited by savages . 
She took the spoils before denouncing the thief . 
For now I 'm a wanted man , forced to run , to fight . 
You were alone , you thought me dead . 
Oh , it 's sinful of you to deprive us of your charming wife . 
Otherwise you 'll be making a cruel and irrevocable mistake . 
I waste money and get headaches . 
It 's horrid ! 
He 's about to die and you leave me here alone !

Uncertainty , that 's what one fears most . 
The battle ! 
Yes , they may kill me .

You gotta cock it to shoot me . 
Reckless ! 
Someone broke into the Montareuils ' last night . 
The police have broken the case . 
He 's in prison at the moment . 
You 're a thief . 
That 's where it really hurts . 
Stop your complaining . 
Destroy property ? 
- I shouldn 't worry about her . 
I fear that was the last gasp . 
Thievery 's no longer what it used to be . 
It 's too sad .

Today we can do whatever we want even get ourselves hurt . 
And since I failed , 
That makes me sick . 
" Sitting on the bench ... shivering ... miserable ... 
- He 's miserable . 
He tried to kill himself . 
Only we , only I am guilty . 
The poor thing ! 
Alarm ! 
Idiot ! 
We 'll work together to destroy Fantomas . 
It 's terrible , and we did not believe the Commissar . 
- We 've killed the girl and the journalist . 
Drop your weapon ! 
I 'd be very unhappy , sir . 
I sure didn 't mean to kill that fellow . 
- I don 't want to hurt you . 
I can 't think of a better way to fight a war .

Getting dizzy is the worst of all . 
I 'm no more than a slut . 
That can 't fool you , for Christ 's sake . 
And it makes me mad at times . 
And my poor dogs ! 
If you knew how she makes it you 'd lose your appetite . 
I 'm going to be killed ! 
If I 'm killed , what will happen to my kid in Katsuura ? 
Only a devil would knowingly kill a nurse . 
I will forgive the poison and the evil . 
I 'm just plain angry at Tadashi . 
But it 's a disgrace to his family . 
I got angry and demanded to know what his plans were . 
In the end , my existence hurt Oshima . 
I have a short temper , especially if I drink . 
I 'll survive even if someone tries to kill me . 
- You say she 's dirty ? 
You really hate your sister that much ? 
The reason you hate them , is itjust a feeling ? 
This place makes me forget my everyday worries . 
I felt empty , I still feel that emptiness . 
- Killed by poison ? 
Why did she kill him ? 
No mistake . 
Other filmmakers will make other fake stories here . 
That is a circular dispute . 
I didn 't come here to start telling lies . 
It 's hard to distrust my sister . 
In short , are we in trouble here ? 
But since I 'm ill disposed of being disposable , 
Aren 't you ashamed ? 
- A kick in the ass . 
- No , not interested . 
- Stupid . 
- Look , you 're the one who 's wrong . 
Are you crying ? 
It 's not that I love her money and not her . 
- Cause you are getting ruined ! 
- What 's wrong ? 
Did you guess the killer ? 
Do you really believe he should go to hell ? 
What 's wrong ? 
I was scared ... where did you put the diary ? 
Listen ... are you scared ? 
I inherited a habit from your poor cousin Roscio ... 
Don 't worry ... 
I never loved him .

The schedule sounds a little punishing . 
You 're awfully tense . 
The tortured , hunted look in her eyes becomes soft . 
You 're always so tense . 
" With me it 's not love but happiness . " 
Two people have been killed . 
Bonnets or not , I am jolly fond of you ! 
Outside his cage , close to the window- blind ; : 
A sick elephant ? 
And gaze out mournfully ; ( All ) Beata mea Domina ! 
Do we clasp dead hands and quiver 
Oh , my pallid and poisonous queen . 
He tried to kill his self , he did . 
A blind cripple . 
And shameful images his eyes must make 
A critic , anonymous , can attack his newly published poems . 
My , how pathetic ! 
How pathetic . 
Stupid and ignorant . 
- Poor thing . 
Temporary insanity , of course ! 
You are part of the class unfortunate ? 
I became guilty with Whelan , when he fell into bed . 
- Is it hell ! 
I do not care one bit ! 
Who had pity for you when was sad in the midst of strangers ? 
Too bad . 
He died for my lips ! 
I was in mourning , doing 11 years . 
It is as if he asked suck it for you ! 
My order wrong , he does not know who he is ! 
Because they are afraid of hell , with their consciences . 
If you do not remove it , the tree will die . 
Stop talking nonsense !

I can kill you with one shot 
I 'll be killed if the organization finds out I 've told you this 
Shall we talk about women , to kill time ? 
We must not love women 
A killer must not be human ; he must be tough and cold 
The enemy is a foreign spy who is sabotaging in our country . 
Yet , your face was devoid of worry . 
My car has broken down . 
I am helpless . 
- Wrong moment ? 
When I enter the field of business , no one dares to confront me . 
It 's helplessness . 
You are preparing to consume poison . 
I am also helpless . 
Damn ! 
Why fear ? 
- What nonsense are you talking ! 
I badly wished to wash these sins . 
Commit suicide ? 
What will you say after you die ? 
But let no harm befall my daughter . 
Don 't worry . 
You 've joined the enemy ? 
The bomb is going to detonate . 
An enemy 's score ! 
We could trace the enemy 's hideout due to you . 
Thy kingdom come on earth as it is in hell . 
I 'm a mad animal . 
Today they need you , because you are going to suffer for them . 
Why is everything so confused ? 
Shit , it 's failed . 
Don 't get mad . 
But He let them suffer each time . 
Not mad at me ? 
I 'll be there in one hour , don 't do anything stupid . 
Instead of doing a bad deal by icing a pal , 
And live and die ... in Aristotle 's works . 
Away with such vain fancies , and despair . 
Why , have you any pain that torture others ? 
Tell me , where is this place that men call Hell ? 
Talk of the Devil , and nothing else . 
Despair doth drive distrust into thy thoughts . 
A surfeit of deadly sin that hath damned both body and soul . 
- So what 's wrong ? 
You can pretend to be a simple , poor girl 
Two things in the world no one can ever hide 
Aren 't you ashamed to be following those girls ? 
" I 'm terribly embarrassed about what happened last night " 
Scary ? 
Shekhar is my son , no doubt . 
Maybe I 'm rotten and cheap . 
Your life is in danger ! 
Henceforth , you must hate me too 
You always threatened me and pushed me around 
I 'm not very cheerful right now . 
Damn ! 
When I think that tartan was half rotten . 
I 'm sorry but I 'm not like this . 
He 's gonna be angry . 
- What if he 's mad at you ? 
Kill them all . 
- No problem . 
Why would he be jealous ? 
The others are wrong . 
What 's wrong with you ? 
I 've got some stupid young men . 
It 's your own fault that you forgot . 
A crying fool ! 
You 've got some nerve , you jerk ! 
You 're so pushy . 
Don 't worry . 
Four years ago , my mother got sick . 
Why did you kill him ? 
We just got distracted and lost sight of our goal , right ? 
Don 't cry . 
Fool ! 
That makes it practically a catastrophe . 
In case of accidental death , double indemnity . 
Just for the hell of it . 
He is a flaming faggot . 
Then how come he got caught stealing five times ? 
Because that would make us not only crazy , but insane . 
Why did Cain kill Abel ? 
You just tell Perry , when I die all my insurance goes to him . 
No more money troubles . 
Stop worrying , will you ? 
I think you 're a bastard . 
Don 't lie to me , you son of a bitch . 
Thirty- one lousy dollars . 
If you do that to my wife she 'll panic . 
I hate him .

So I killed them . 
Fourteen and helpless . 
That is ridiculous ! 
Not by violence . 
Bleeding rotten taste he 's got . 
You 're wasting our time . 
I think you 're wrong about her . 
You 're saying it 's my fault ? 
You was wrong about Potts . 
Kids complained again . 
Fourteen and helpless . 
Don 't worry , your lot leaves this term .

It 's not like I 'm in a church alone with the souls . 
Too bad . 
Death still touches me . 
Now you 're lying there , saying nothing . 
It wasn 't my fault . 
Poor girl . 
You scare me . 
I guess it 's my fault .

Is life everything , and death nothing ? 
I 'll bring the criminal in at any price . 
Pain ? 
- Crazy ! 
I can 't stand this cruelty ! 
But if you wind up in Hell , 
The only way he can beat me is if he really is the Devil . 
Do you think I 'm the Devil ? 
The criminal escaped . 
I 'm so miserable . 
No , there 's no Hell . 
Things will get ugly today . 
Not only strange , but dangerous also . 
You were right , Truncador , that man is the Devil ! 
Damn you ! 
Son of the Devil ! 
You 're crazy ! 
Come on , destroy me if you can !

Pain ? 
I want to spare you from an unfair life . 
- Lunatic ! 
I can 't stand this cruelty ! 
I don 't fear your sadism . 
If not ... have a good trip ! 
And if you wind up in hell , give the Devil my address ! 
The only way he can beat me is if he really is the Devil ! 
The criminal escaped . 
I 'm so miserable ! 
No , there is no Hell ! 
Okay , but I want to kill him myself ! 
Son of the Devil ! 
You haven 't beaten me ! 
My wife Suga is the problem . 
Unworthy ? 
Isaburo Sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn . 
No , she doesn 't offend me . 
I hated her for it . 
Young Lord Masamoto died of illness ? 
Even if you ruin the family ? 
You needn 't worry . 
Tomi , you fool . 
The chamberlain 's intervention would aggravate matters . 
Without fail .

What 's happening to you is the work of the enemy , Johan . 
That could be dangerous , couldn 't it ? 
Don 't get me wrong . 
You know it only makes you sad . 
No , i 'm wrong ; it 's gone up to ten thousand dollars . 
That could be dangerous , couldn 't it ?

No , i 'm wrong ; it 's gone up to ten thousand dollars . 
No that 's the problem . 
It 's very difficult . 
You can 't tell me you 'd have trouble laying that tart . 
The more girls a guy has the more suspicious I am . 
But it bothers me that you 're on bad terms . 
If everyone minded his own business I wouldn 't disturb anybody . 
Worthless . 
At its weakest point it 's darkness . 
Too bad . 
Actually he 's angry at the girl . 
And I can 't imagine a dandy not being heroic . 
You 're an immoral little slut . 
It 's very difficult . 
all I see is your faults . 
But it bothers me that you 're on bad terms . 
Worthless . 
And I can 't imagine a dandy not being heroic . 
Just in time for the bloody blackout . 
They can blame you because he picked your hotel to hide in . 
- Such a tragedy about poor Dr. Philipot . 
That must have been a very terrible experience , Mr. Jones . 
Ogoun Feraille , the voodoo God of war . 
No , no sugar . 
- Philipot 's interrupted funeral . 
- You can 't be jealous of the past . 
- I can 't hurt Angelito . 
Dangerous ? 
I think we 'll put this poor old thing out to grass . 
Jones is as crooked as hell , Philipot . 
- One of my men was killed . 
Things will be sad now at the hotel . 
Doesn 't want to die on the steps , either . 
No , no , you 'll never get Jones . 
You 've been crying . 
- Oh , no , no . 
He knows all the tricks of guerrilla war . " 
- Do you plan to attack with this job lot ?

The smell of war , Major Grau . 
Don 't worry , Liesowski , the responsibility is mine . 
Oh , no , I 'm not flattering you . 
He killed 40 Russians single- handed , sir . 
I 'm sorry , sir , but I have a horror of death . 
Greatly regret it . 
Two boys I knew are already dead in Russia . 
Noisy bastards . 
What 's it like having people try to kill you ? 
Terrible . 
And don 't worry about Tanz . 
Damn it , what was it about ? 
Hitler ordered the general not to expose himself to enemy fire . 
I want only combat troops , no decaying old men or children . 
Well , that wasn 't so bad . 
Impossible , it 's too dirty . 
Since we must give medals to mass murderers , 
Oh , a sex crime , I see . 
I thought you might be tired . 
If the generals kill Hitler , the war will end . 
My madness is on a smaller , more secular scale . 
Are you going to kill me too ? 
The charge is treason . 
For treason . 
And to know that our leader in war is with us again on this ...

Death ? 
There 'll be trouble if the work 's held up . 
Roney 's having a little difficulty with a bomb- disposal squad . 
You 'll get us into trouble ! 
- You were here during the war ? 
And the trouble we have with creeping damp , haven 't we ? 
They 'll disturb it all . 
He 's a career militarist of the worst type . 
- Oh , what a stench ! 
- Even if they were dead ? 
This was the bad one ? 
Outraged ! 
Damn ! 
If I go wrong , you shout . 
- Is he dead ? 
No , no . 
- I just feel a bit sick . 
Death shall have no dominion ! 
THE LlVING CORPSE 
Then you killed him with your own hands ? 
Don 't talk nonsense . 
Are you insane , doctor ? 
Doctor , I think you must have been infected by this evil 
We have to destroy the King Vampire 
But if they are bitten again , death is inevitable 
Accident ?

They , besides fury and horror , nothing .

No , I do not love . 
We are in trouble too ! 
They , besides fury and horror , nothing .

- ls he really dead , inspector ? 
The coroner certified his death .

But am I the only one at fault here ? 
" Don 't be scared " , I 'd say , 
What have I got to be ashamed of ? 
Bastards ! 
- Come on , don 't be stupid ... 
Slut . 
I 'm sorry it all went wrong . 
An old dog , flea- ridden , blind and half- deaf . 
Imprisoned again on the Isle of Elba . 
One of us is lying ... 
They act selectively ... ... a police action , not an act of war . 
You failed . 
And were you scared ?

Stop moving ; I 'm tired , I tell you .

I hate tuna . 
The other night , at the council , he seemed sad . 
Tastes like ginger ale , but worse . 
Such glum faces . 
And when fought , it is best fought to the death . 
Sad . 
That is a signal for " enemy advancing . " 
He 'd get a very bloody nose if he were to do that . 
- To death you have led your brigade . 
Not a bad business , eh ? 
What the hell ? 
Poor bastard . 
If you kill him , the cops will be after us . 
It 'd be a shame to pass this one up . 
I 'm tired ! 
There can be no mistakes this time . 
I 'm beginning to understand just what kind of foe Yei Lin is . 
You can go blind . 
He says he 'll kill me if you don 't give him the formula . 
I know you want to kill me . 
I thought I 'd killed you , and yet ... 
Shoot ! 
The cave 's collapse must have startled them . 
It 'll be a waste of both of our times . 
Your company exports weapons . 
Nonsense ! 
Your company was going bankrupt . 
The Gokemidoro said we 'd be destroyed . 
Have you both gone mad ? 
No trouble Iater . 
Don 't worry .

- Oh , " kill you . " 
You broke the stage with a somersault . 
Miss , I had your dirty clothes washed and ironed . 
When they argue , it 's we who suffer . 
I 'll beat you to death . 
Tell them report to City Hall , or get arrested ! 
Master Wong will pay for all the damages . 
Goddamn steps ! 
So when we are attacked , how will we defend ourselves ? 
Many people have been injured . 
Hey , why 'd you steal my bowl ? 
I 'm under house arrest , soon I 'll have to fight . 
I don 't fear guns . 
- Are we really allowed to fight ? 
Wong Fei- Hung , I arrest you on charges of treason ! 
They killed him and captured 13th Aunt . 
Don 't worry , we have guns . 
The chief will kill me . 
These are the last minutes of a bitter fight . 
What a sabotage act ! 
The chief will kill me . 
These are the last minutes of a bitter fight .

I lose 65, 000 . 
There must be a loser . 
It puts me at a disadvantage .

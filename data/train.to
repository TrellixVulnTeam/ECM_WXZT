Lucienne … you don’ t love me anymore ?

When one isn 't rich , one has to work .

Did he say he loved her ? 
Maybe he doesn 't love her . 
This should be easy to settle . 
Laugh if you like , but it 's the truth . 
Just 'cause he 's handsome , does he have to marry a Rothschild ? 
I know you love Fanny . 
You love Fanny . 
You can 't love the girl . 
It isn 't true .

I wish I were away from it . 
He 's working under a terrific strain .

Madam the Princess of Chabran wins the first prize in one voice . 
An old friend Loulou invited without telling me . 
And I who went to see it every month , for pleasure . 
A good piece of advice ! 
So you don 't care that your wife is a flirt ! 
It 's perfectly justified , Madam . 
It 's a small price to pay for our happiness .

OK , chief . 
They just laughed at it .

That might prove effective . 
Just one more , darling , and then you 'll have to dress .

But I 'm happy , darling .

How handsome my Alexis was in his dress uniform . 
He was the hot- blooded kind . 
Fortunately , both her husband and I are peaceful men . 
No ... but I got an idea he was laughing at us all the time . 
You lick the hand that feeds you ... the hand that beats you too . 
Lucienne ... you don 't love me anymore ? 
Oh , not white slavery ! 
Foreman , will you please read the verdict ? 
- Be with you in a minute , darling . 
Oh , yes , darling , yes , it 's a lovely day . 
They 're my friends . 
No , I love it . 
Nothing of that kind . 
- Listen , sweetheart . 
That 's lucky . 
Yesterday , you won your first case in five months . 
But , Jan , darling , this isn 't love . 
Why , he 's sweet . 
Why , the way I love you , there 's nothing left to think about . 
Any reason 's good . 
[ ACE LAUGHS ] 
I wish you did . 
- Yes , yes . 
- Yes , I did .

But at home , I have a wonderful one . 
Yes , even Franz . 
Promise that you won 't look behind that curtain ! 
It 's a nice day and we will drive a bit around .

I wish I were . 
It is a great pleasure to meet you , Count . 
You can laugh as much as you want . 
Now , you are interested in spiders . 
When beautiful and plump spiders are not available ... maybe . 
You are strong . 
And I thought you were a wise man . 
Thank God , she is still alive . 
And please open the windows and let some fresh air in . 
You 'll never harm that bat . 
You wanna take all the fun out of life ?

Oh , yes .

Since you moved in , trade 's been pretty slow .

It will be a great day for China when that price is paid . 
I don 't care if you were going to leave with him . 
Please forgive me for my lack of faith . 
It might be a good plan to get them out of the way . 
Well , can 't a girl cry a little bit when she 's happy ?

We 've been sweethearts since we were kids .

Because then he 'll want love . 
You do love me . 
But you know , it really is going to be charming . 
I 'd like to see Mr. Gaerste , please . 
That won 't do . 
- Bill , you 'd better take Irene home . 
I could have made good here . 
Better get some sleep . 
Here , you better smoke one of mine . 
What do I care where he gets it ? 
You 're glorifying the gangster by giving him all this publicity . 
Kids aren 't even safe to go to school . 
You better have a drink , Tony .

I find it thrilling . 
Madam the Princess of Chabran wins the first prize in one voice . 
An old friend Loulou invited without telling me . 
And I who went to see it every month , for pleasure . 
A good piece of advice ! 
So you don 't care that your wife is a flirt ! 
It 's perfectly justified , Madam . 
It 's a small price to pay for our happiness . 
" I don 't love you anymore " . 
That won 't do any good to your affairs . 
Yes . 
Well , dear , I decided to come home for dinner after all . 
Yes , sir ! 
Oh , doesn 't look so good at that . 
Well , he can 't move , dear . 
If you get to know 50 beautiful women ... be this way , will you ? 
I 'll wade through the mud and love it . 
I hope I will be lucky enough to find it . 
I want you to accept these as a token of our friendship . 
OK , chief . 
They just laughed at it . 
You better look out . 
That might prove effective . 
Just one more , darling , and then you 'll have to dress .

- Yes . 
Yes .

Let me save you . 
I don 't care . 
Well , ladies , let 's combine business with pleasure . 
It simply won 't stand the wear and tear . 
The world 's bright for the first time in three years . 
That 's no way for a great big man to act . 
I 'll give his party special attention . 
To trade the liberty of his associate for his own . 
I expected to meet a lot of interesting people and talk to them . 
That 's funny . 
You 've won . 
I 'll take care of everything in the house . 
It 's true . 
But , Joan , you and Jerry are gonna be so happy . 
I can take care of her , all right . 
I won 't even let him out of my sight . 
You should have complete rest and relaxation . 
Buck didn 't give us time to say good evening . 
If she dies , you won 't have to . 
Yes . 
Yes , there 's a two cent tax on every check you write . 
Well , that 's nice of her . 
I 'd begun to think you weren 't coming to the party . 
What a wise mother . 
Enjoy your ride ? 
You 're very kind . 
Why did you lie to me if it wasn 't true ? 
Yes . 
Yes , there 's a two cent tax on every check you write .

You 're very kind . 
Why did you lie to me if it wasn 't true ? 
- Yes , I guess it does . 
- Powerful cider , ain 't it ? 
Everybody loves everybody . 
But you haven 't the comforts ... 
And I 'm as smart now as I ever will be . 
I 've been very happy there . 
Yes , I guess it does . 
Powerful cider , ain 't it , Tom ? 
Everybody loves everybody . 
But you haven 't the comforts ... 
And I 'm as smart now as I ever will be . 
I 've been very happy there . 
But it 's wonderful . 
- I thought she was splendid . 
Yes , I know . 
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here ? 
Besides , she 's rather pretty . 
I was little , slim , but hard as a diamond . 
- That 's very interesting . 
Save that for the office . 
- You don 't like to see me enjoying myself . 
- He was a nice fellow . 
You always felt better when he came along . 
You loved the Baron , didn 't you ? 
I won 't live long . 
We 'll find a great doctor . 
But it 's wonderful . 
- I thought she was splendid .

Nothing nearly as grand , Lieutenant . 
Well , I 'll tell you , that 's a relief to hear . 
Yes , a logical question . 
I 'd be delighted . 
If I can ever be of any help ... 
I enjoyed it . 
I was clearly in line for the position that you gave George . 
The least I could hope for is some understanding from my wife . 
Born smart , as they say . 
Yes , yes , you 've demonstrated all that . 
Ah , yes , here we are . 
A glorious , torn Paraguayan flag flutters over the fort walls . 
- Yes , yes . 
How beautiful you are , more than ever this evening , Mariù ! 
Speak to me of love , Mariù ! 
Speak to me of love , Mariù ! 
Good night .

This is a day of joy and happiness for all of us . 
And he didn 't even raise a hand to defend himself 
And God will help you , my boy . 
Yes , yes ... 
Hold yourself in , and save it up for a real Frenchman . 
I 'm not a sick man . 
To make a long story short , I wish to marry Elsa . 
Wonderful day . 
It was inspiration as it only had been given to you by God . 
Always trusting , believing anybody . 
Be a good girl , please stay in that room with your grandmother . 
I think you 'd better go back tonight . 
Open unto us the door of thy loving- kindness 
Hit the sympathy seeker ! 
The sympathy seeker ! 
Work ; but your strength let union teach . 
# To break - why then , to- morrow , truly , 
# Help me ??? . 
That book is outstanding ! 
In memory of my dad , help me . 
But I 'm waiting since three years , dear ! 
Do you mean that he has got time to be happy ? ... 
- So , do you like it here ? 
You won 't find anything cleaner in the world . 
I don 't care if he is your son . 
In her heart , she 'll be happy . 
To speak to me like that ! 
It 's not as if your mother doesn 't love you . 
Yes . 
- Yes . 
Half an hour ago , we were chatting like old friends , 
If that makes you happy . 
Yes . 
But now get up , darling . 
Yes yes yes yes 
Not yet enough success ? 
They stole his poetry and faith ... and then they dropped him . 
Cheers . 
- You 're not ugly . 
What if I fell in love with another man , Peterle ? 
I was perfectly healthy . 
But Peterle , I 'm not poisoning you !

Good night ! - 
You 'll arrive here for your pleasure ! 
Please , please ! 
I won 't do anything to you !

So that gives you a pretty nice motive . 
I never killed nobody . 
There might be something interesting on the film . 
Yeah , it looks like it was done with a blunt instrument . 
If I can help you , let me know . 
Do you wish to see Mr Chalmers ? 
He 's not as dumb as he looks . 
Then wrote the note and put the pencil in his hand , huh ? 
If it isn 't that , it 's a good imitation on it . 
Good . 
Yes ? 
Darling , I 'm hot on the trail . 
Yes , I am glad . 
But you 're much more clever than I gave you credit for . 
If he says a thing is good , it is good . 
Then love . 
The count 'll take care of me , all right . 
Yes . 
Yes , yes , yes . 
But there are light buoys to mark the safe channel .

- Can 't you see how true that is ? 
I won 't live that long . 
The guy who runs it is a pretty soft egg . 
I was silly enough to believe you when you said you loved me . 
I told you I was satisfied with the way things are . 
But I 'm in love with another woman . 
I won 't do it ! 
It 's still better to be honorably free .

A better- off home . 
Will I be able to let my friends know I 'm safe ? 
But it would be easy for you to do it yourself after dinner . 
Nice girl , Mah- Li . 
Well , couldn 't we speak of something more pleasant ? 
You won 't allow one single human feeling to reach you . 
Yes . 
Great guy . 
The joke was certainly on him . 
I think you heve underestimeted the good doctor . 
You won 't ellow one single humen feeling to reech you . 
Yes . 
You picked a nice day for it . 
- Don 't it look cute ? 
- No , I 'm not , honey , but you know - Wayne , darling ! 
It 's the British lion in honor of Lord Ferncliffe . 
- Good heavens ! 
Were you in love with her ? 
How is the great profile today ? 
- No , you won 't ! 
Lay it out for me like a good kid . 
- You don 't mean - Yes , but I saved it for you .

On the other hand - 
Yes , stare ! 
And I love you . 
But , uh , another glass of champagne might be acceptable , huh ? 
I thought there was something better in store for you . 
- My husband , yes . 
And then hear them laughing at you ! 
It 's an interesting world . 
Welcome home , Chuji . 
We were sure you 'd be safe . 
Then we 'd rescue them . 
Please forgive me . 
Good luck . 
- Ask your best friend . 
Let it go easy now , right back . 
Save it , Duchess , save it . 
I guess I 'd better get out of these . 
Won 't let me have any men visitors . 
I haven 't any friends and I haven 't any money . 
You 'd better call the police . 
That can all be arranged for you in strict confidence . 
Well , you must admit that our first meeting was rather formal .

They 're quite out of hand tonight . 
- What a laugh . 
I better quit , huh ? 
I could play the lead myself without any trouble . 
Got the greatest news of my life tonight .

Old Faithful 's gone blank on me completely . 
Joe will do his best .

Surely he 's always like that , silent and shy . 
A good day , I kiss your hand . 
You just haven 't any talent for a party decorator . 
I don 't have to know , I can celebrate by myself . 
Fritz has met a girl now ... whom he loves ... and she loves him . 
First lieutenant , it is a matter of an affair of honor . 
Yes ... 
Say good night to Father and go to bed . 
We 'll say that when things get better , we can come back . 
Don 't make me laugh . 
I wish we 'd stayed in the country . 
When a guy gave me a chance to make $5 , sure , I took it . 
It 's simply that things are going to be better now . 
We 'll have a beautiful old- fashioned visit . 
- But I love you . 
No , I mean so perfectly poised and cool . 
There was a wonderful horse and a true pal . 
You know , you have a perfectly charming smile . 
You and your new freedom . 
- You 'd better go . 
But the laugh 's on me , offering a marriage license to a pickup . 
- We won 't have to rehearse that . 
- Be the funniest thing you ever did . 
- I do trust you . 
I was just putting on a good act . 
You are very gracious .

Yes , that was the man . 
This is the strange , vicarious pleasure that remains for me .

I wish I 'd left him on his island . 
We need excitement . 
Well , then , how about giving me passage on your ship ? 
That 's pretty plain . 
Well , what a fine partner you 've turned out to be . 
You better lie down . 
Well , I like that .

Not such a one as this , Mr. Copperfield wouldn 't have liked . 
- I don 't love you at all , do I ? 
Oh , I ain 't what I could wish myself to be , Daniel . 
I 'll be happy , Peggotty . 
Jane Murdstone , will you have the goodness not to interrupt me . 
Good day to you , sir . 
Yes . 
Even when you fall in love ? 
- Yes . 
Well , this is an unexpected pleasure , Miss Trotwood . 
In these circumstances , yes . 
With the greatest pleasure . 
You 're free . 
How do you know I 'm not a murderer ? 
He 's a nice dancer . 
Your little Cosette is happy and in well health . 
It won 't be long now . 
You won 't find money anywhere . 
Treating a woman like this ! 
Let me earn enough to save my dear Cosette . 
Mother Superior will speak to the mayor . 
She was a good girl . 
Snd now let 's choose some pretty dolls , children . 
That of 1832 shall triumph . 
You got a funny look . 
" Thank you , kind friend . 
He must 've been the best of the lot . 
They 'll never come to no good . 
You 're quite a strong man . 
The chief won 't have it . 
Our friends on rue Aubry- le- Boucher have got us covered . 
- We won 't forget you . 
Is it just a hand wound ? 
We will meet again , won 't we ? 
Why , it 's true ! 
I won 't try to escape . 
Feeling better ? 
It 's nothing to die . 
You 're very welcome . 
And you won 't want me to pay you ? 
- Yes , Monsieur Madeleine . 
[ Laughing ] 
What do I care ? 
Yes . 
Might as well , for all the chance they ever give me . 
Must they treat them that way ? 
- If you 're interested , sir . 
That 's good . 
Well , it 's - it 's natural that you should want to leave me . 
Making fun of a famous man like Dr. Gogol . 
- The brace will give sufficient support . 
There are other outlets for musical talent besides playing . 
Please , don 't say things like that , darling . 
You are cruel , but only to be kind . 
Ten fingers , every nerve , every muscle works perfectly . 
Why can 't I conquer love ? 
Help !

Honorable Red Armyman Pugaev ! 
Fearless Syn Xing ! 
Well , it won 't take us so long to get out of the desert , Ma . 
I hope you like it out west , Ma .

The Singin ' Riders will take care of him anyway . 
I won 't listen to you . 
I 'll make it my job to bring him back to you safe . 
He 's talking like a rich kid . 
You 're great ! 
I love Little Luo for his dreams . 
Master Hu is clearly the smartest man in the world . 
Won 't you tell me ? 
So you won 't talk , huh ? 
- Yes . 
Ha ! 
You better phone him up and tell him you won 't be there . 
You certainly love me . 
What you say is delightful . 
You won 't feel a thing . 
I survived . 
My God , they don 't make them like me anymore . 
- That 's easy to say . 
You don 't feel good ? 
- I wasn 't much help . 
You must be happy , Manya , happy . 
- I wasn 't much help . 
You must be happy , Manya , happy . 
- If it makes you feel any better . 
- Of course not , she 's a most attractive girl . 
An honest US tourist doing Europe ? 
- No , I love having you try ! 
- I hope so . 
- That case is perfectly safe with me ! 
- I couldn 't help myself ! 
- Thanks . 
- Yes . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
I enjoyed it . 
- I wish you wouldn 't bow so much . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
I enjoyed it .

Tie up my love 's tongue , bring him silently . 
I see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment . 
Helena , I love you . 
And love Helena . 
A tomb must cover thy sweet eyes . 
We 're trying to be friendly with you . 
He 'd have made a great dog . 
That 's a pretty good guess . 
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason . 
I don 't want money from you , my friend . 
Oh , you pretty things . 
Perhaps that particular commandment isn 't respected up here . 
You seem to have all the comforts of home , Mr. Thornton - 
Now , don 't pull any of that honest lawyer stuff on me . 
Oh , yes , there was one clue : 
- I 'm glad to hear it . 
Oh , save your breath . 
- You can 't take chances like that . 
The sooner they learn that , the better . 
He 'll do it beautifully . 
And she won 't be talking . 
Yes , l" ve been expecting him . 
Yes , and the take- off , too . 
If somebody will give me a hand , 
Good flyers pull themselves out of tailspins . 
It would sort of justify her faith in bringing me back again . 
And , Al , you better send a couple of cars out here in a hurry .

Now you are save . 
Achieve your winning , 
I just heard only one winning , 
Running away like that ! 
Trusted Kumazawa with the scroll . 
It 's not that we don 't trust you . 
Just that they are very valuable statues . 
Do as you like ! 
Perfect ! 
Snooping around like that ! 
Good luck . 
You think you 're funny ? 
Oh , my gracious ! 
Yes , sir . 
I 'm glad my theories furnish you with the chance to be witty . 
Yes , sir . 
I hope you 'll do all you can to get it back for me . 
Yes . 
Relieve me of your time ! 
What was that beautiful expression ? 
I can only tell you that he needs help . 
You wanted to help others . 
I won 't let you throw away your soul for me . 
Jesus of Nazareth is stronger than the Sanhedrin ! 
We can not imprisoned for the holidays . 
But what you care that galileo ? 
Yeah , yeah , yeah , I heard myself . 
Yes ! 
Is it true ? 
It is a good opportunity to show your power . 
Make a miracle . 
" For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore " 
Good day , Dr. Vollin .

Yes , they sure do . 
Kingo , won 't you change your mind ? 
Yes . 
He 's interested in what 's fashionable . 
I 'm not lying . 
She 's precious to me . 
I believed he was better than that . 
I think you would do better to marry Fujio . 
You must be faithful to yourself . 
I did it out of friendship . 
You 'd love to show her as a freak attraction . 
I can 't help you there . 
Mixed feelings are good . 
Give me one good reason , Mr. Shaw . 
She won 't escape again . 
Anything I can help you with ? 
You 're not a prisoner . 
This is a private party . 
I love you so much . 
Courage ! 
Be strong ! 
Will you agree to meet with him in order to save us ? 
What a surprise to see you in good shape . 
Nowhere is better than home . 
Is it true ? 
A prize in every box . 
Then she 's not just stealing for two . 
I promise I 'll protect you . 
I hope you got shoes to go with that bag . 
Just not the thief we thought we were looking for . 
Grand larceny is going to stick . 
Everything Wakeman said was true . 
Hey, Ryan, I need you to do me a favor . 
You may not believe it, officer, but they were happy before . 
Looks like there 's a good print on it . 
Nothing for my peculiar talents . 
It 's really lovely . 
It 's too early in the morning to be playful . 
He can take care of himself . 
Just think of the whole thing as a good riddance . 
That 's carrying things pretty far . 
I wish I 'd never known him . 
Won 't you please marry him ? 
Oh , and about your friend ... 
She liked to go up on the roof of the Matsuya . 
And that was when she fell in love with Kosugi- san . 
You sure don’ t seem well . 
I don’ t think she ever thought of having Mother help her out . 
Take good care of yourself . 
Aren 't you the great lady ! 
We 'll call her Divine . 
And you profit . 
Yes , Mme Nicou , it 's an epidemic . 
One good shot , that 's the way .

What you forget ... is that Marseille is full of good honest men . 
Justin should protect them ! 
- They 're not really sick . 
If you walked like you talk , you 'd fall on your face ! 
Thanks , Justin ! 
You should have been proud to have been his deputy ! 
Yes , her name was Lecocher . 
Yet , you are a good Christian .

Nothing would help her but a glass of champagne . 
He 's in love again ! 
A joke is a joke , but when my honor ... 
This is the very nicest present I got .

Yes , sir .

Then I decided I better fetch you . 
She 's been a great comfort to Missa Cary . 
She 's going to sleep , darling . 
I won 't forget this . 
This looks mighty funny to me . 
I expects they take him out pretty soon now . 
You 're a great big girl . 
- I won 't . 
Your father and Colonel Morrison are going free .

Thanks . 
My luck will change . 
Well , you certainly didn 't come here as a friend . 
I 'll get it for you tonight without fail . 
But how on earth was I to know that you really cared for me ? 
I 'll admit I was a little uncouth , but you did like me . 
But , darling , I know nothing of this . 
If you want to save your life , you better come with me . 
Yes .

They run before this Jezebel of France like a foul air ! 
Have I also found a friend ? 
She wins men to her side in gentle ways . 
Though he never dares put it quite that boldly . 
I love your son . 
They 'll not harm her son . 
Aye , he spoke true . 
And his friends ? 
Poor , generous friends . 
She knows he wins support for my cause abroad . 
I don 't care . 
You threw away a kingdom for love , for Bothwell . 
- Mary Stuart , save yourself . 
Naturally , I 'm free to marry again ... ... if I choose to . 
But now ... ... I 'll find a way to win . 
Have I also found a friend ? 
- She wins men to her side in gentle ways . 
I love your son . 
And everyone made a great fuss over me . 
They 'll not harm her son . 
You cannot hurt him now . 
And his friends ? 
Poor , generous friends . 
She knows he wins support for my cause abroad . 
I don 't care . 
But , yes ... ... you are Elizabeth . 
You threw away a kingdom for love . 
- Mary Stuart , save yourself . 
Oh , splendid , sir . 
Elsa , darling , they 're watching . 
You 've been a success . 
Yes , but Geoff , Elsa 's in love with me . 
This is splendid . 
- Yes , I think so . 
Thank heaven I missed you . 
She knew perfectly well you were arriving today . 
But I love you . 
- Yes , sir , on Chukoti . 
Oh , my friend , life is sweet and dear when one cannot have it . 
I thought the best thing we could do was reach here for help . 
You love him , don 't you ? 
- Your Excellency . 
God bless you . 
Oh , splendid , Sir .

Oh , he 's a bit confused , but he 's doing the best he can . 
Take it easy . 
I won 't let the old bogeyman get you . 
Well , it 's not a ghost !

It 's a nice little company . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Nice horse . 
You really like this ? 
Yes . 
I wish I could , but I haven 't a free moment . 
Well , this is a surprise . 
He doesn 't care . 
It 's amazing how little a man really knows about himself . 
I don 't want to marry a woman who 's in love with someone else . 
It is wiser to be friendly to him . 
We promised the Larrimores we 'd drop in on their party . 
Yes , you do . 
You won 't come , miss ? 
Yes , I know .

The next one will have a perfect brain . 
A friend of Marcel 's is a welcome guest . 
She 's going to be beautiful . 
Perhaps it 's all for the best , Malita . 
They know that my freedom means they 're finished . 
- Yes . 
The frosty weather hasn 't done your flowers any good , has it ? 
- Yes , I know , Mother . 
I 'm so glad . 
Yes . 
You won 't get to the front office to talk your way out of it . 
Well , you decided to tell the truth , didn 't you ? 
Never have I seen a night so beautiful . 
Don 't you think we better wake him up and be on our way ? 
Let me save my strength for Charlie Mason . 
Good Time Charlie , that 's me from now on . 
Next time I 'll know better than to play poker with women . 
Yes , sir . 
She 's the kind I 'd like you to pick next time . 
Smiles , do me a very , very great favor , will you ? 
Yes , sure .

We are quite satisfied . 
- It won 't happen again , Your Highness . 
They love it so much it follows them around . 
It ain 't healthy . 
Oh , nothing is hopeless for a good detective . 
I 'm not a bad guy at heart . 
Great names were involved . 
Pretty , isn 't it ? 
It won 't be necessary to send a message to your government . 
Yes . 
I hope so . 
Well , I think I 'll take a turn on the top deck . 
Possibly , if the opportunity presented itself . 
Merko 's clever .

Pretty tune . 
That 's the thanks I get for my years of se ice ? 
They won 't want to kiss me . 
It 's that cow who won 't stick to her kitchen ! 
I love him unbearably . 
I 'll forge joy for others . 
All that so that Juliette can be proud of her husband . 
He didn 't have the means to support a family . 
If you knew what my life is like ! 
He spent three days waiting for help . 
Gentlemen , we have the country to save fiirst .

Yes , a national calamity . 
Don 't you see that great big buffalo laying there kickin ' ? 
Pleased to meet you .

Though you done your best . 
We won 't forget what Bill Hickok has done , Cody .

No , but a friend of yours has ... a man named Von Helsing . 
Talking like that won 't help . 
I 'll teach you a little respect ! 
He 's innocent ! 
When we joined , we were asked if we were courageous . 
I don 't care what the y say , but please shut m y eyes . 
We won 't be able to take the fort tonight . 
But you 've got a great heart ! 
Courage is not tested in a cantina . 
I told you it was easy for me to get shot . 
It 's one of those rare cases , if we act fast , we can save him . 
He 's as good as any man we have , and better than most !

He was a nice fella . 
- I thought he was a friend of yours . 
They got a good card on tonight . 
- Yeah , well , he 's still a cop to me . 
Well , well , Benny , what 's the matter ? 
You 've got a great nose for news . 
Oh , you look so pretty , you look perfectly lovely . 
Oh , yes , and when do you think you will get them , tomorrow ? 
Oh , yeah , yeah . 
They have nice perfumes here . 
Well , you 're not too tired to hear the truth , are you ? 
I hope I do . 
I told you a million times to always take the easy way out . 
She won 't put the finger on him . 
But what good is it gonna do us ? 
I don 't care anything about her . 
" Detective Daniel Barr promoted to Captain . " 
Oh , yes . 
I won 't , if you 'll do me a favor .

Very interesting , son . 
Very , very good . 
Get lucky ! 
You looked so funny asleep . 
A friend of yours ? 
But you wouldn 't like it if I made fun of your story . 
Well , at last I see things in their true light . 
She 's in this play with Jennings . 
Listen , Tommy , I honestly don 't mind things for myself . 
It 's just that we 've both known the best of each other . 
Yes . 
Thank you ! 
They say this year ' s crop is very good . 
I wish everybody drove like Mr. Thank You . 
That ' s true . 
Salesmen need mustaches to foist dignity , right ? 
Thank you ! 
They say this year 's crop is very good . 
I wish everybody drove like Mr. Thank You . 
That 's true . 
Salesmen need mustaches to foist dignity , right ? 
It 's one of our best . 
- It didn 't do you any good . 
I thought you were my most intimate friend . 
Looks elegant . 
Well , speak freely . 
- Yes ? 
Up to now you 've been a faithful and trustworthy worker . 
Maybe it 's my fault , but it 's not because I hate you . 
He watches 'em very close so they won 't do nothing bad . 
[ Laughs ] 
- I love her , and we 're to be married . 
You 've made me happy . 
Yes . 
Isn 't he simply wonderful ? 
Oh , you mustn 't say that , darling . 
Aren 't you happy here ? 
I 'm sorry , darling , but you 'll be better off this way . 
They 're going to take me to Heaven . 
I 'm grateful for all you contributed . 
It was you who pushed me on and inspired me . 
- And all about you the soft , sweet smell of spring . 
Marie merely wrote a poetic letter to an imaginary friend . 
Is there anything we can do to help ? 
And glories ?? ?? 
He 's reaIly not a bad sort . 
With a very good reason why ? 
For it 's gonna make you nice and strong ?

She thought Genevieve would protect me better . 
Life insurance is triumphant . 
You 've given up hope before they 've examined him . 
I don 't feel good . 
Yes , J. J. Oh , I 'm sorry , honestly . 
Well , it better be . 
It 's a good show , you 're swell in it . 
Yes . 
You 've been so good to me . 
Good morning , Omocha . 
Yes . 
I brought you some of your favorite : eel and burdock . 
Your shop has a bright future . 
What a pretty design ! 
I didn 't care who saw me . 
Thank you for taking it so well . 
You go ahead and pick something good . 
I 'm glad to hear you say that . 
Welcome back . 
Good evening . 
I just hope she isn 't Ieft crippled . 
This is what happens when you treat men Iike that . 
Something Iike this won 't make me give in to men . 
I wish they never existed ! 
You 've been so good to me . 
Good morning , Omocha . 
Yes . 
I brought you some of your favorite :

I 'm glad to hear you say that . 
I 'm not lying . 
Welcome back . 
Good evening . 
I just hope she isn 't left crippled . 
This is what happens when you treat men like that . 
Something like this won 't make me give in to men . 
I wish they never existed ! 
Too much rich food again ? 
I 've found you a great apartment . 
The reason I 'm so fit is because of my regular moxa treatments . 
I 'II find a nice man for you . 
I can 't even face my friends . 
A slight case of romance , mr . 
Never had the pleasure , i 'm sure . 
You said you would help me . 
Look around for some peace and quiet to land in . 
Good night , mike . 
I know , but - ok , mike . 
Nothing as glamorous as that . 
For the love of mike , will you shut up ? 
I , for i love you , darling . 
Ha ha ha ! 
There 's a powerful fine- looking fellow out here . 
Please , please , go away . 
Yes , me . 
What 's good in the next race ? 
Ha ha ha ! 
There 's a powerful fine- looking fellow out here . 
Please , please , go away . 
Yes , me . 
What 's good in the next race ? 
I do but keep the peace . 
- Good heart , at what ? 
Oh , trespass sweetly urged . 
What satisfaction cans 't thou have tonight ? 
Good night . 
If you be he , sir , I desire some confidence with you . 
Courage , man . 
- I thought all for the best . 
Heaven is here , where Juliet lives . 
O God , did Romeo 's hand shed Tybalt 's blood ? 
There 's no trust , no faith , no honesty in men . 
Blistered be thy tongue for such a wish . 
Past hope , past cure , past help . 
Give me thy hand , one writ with me in sour misfortune 's book . 
Oh , my love , my wife . 
O comfortable friar , where is my lord ? 
O brother Montague , give me thy hand . 
This is for protecting my family and winning the case . 
Yes . 
Prices won 't fall . 
Yes . 
Good morning ! 
We were fortunate that the shopkeeper went to pee . 
Yes . 
Giving her all these things too won 't suffice ? 
You and your friend . 
Yes . 
Why do you care about its dance moves ? 
Yes . 
You better shut your mouth . 
Why do you care ? 
- I 'd be ready to go with you anywhere you wanted ! 
It 's true . 
Yes , you have very good eyes , Excellency . 
Yes , I promise . 
Ushi- san , I 'd like to ask you a favour . 
Why can 't he live honestly ? 
Instead , I 've good arms . 
I think I 'm very kind with you . 
Yes . 
O- nami , you can also make a living under the favour of my Boss . 
It needs just 300 ryos to save her from selling herself 
Tell it again clearly . 
Thank you for your kindness . 
Waht a laugh ! 
Well , go and escape ! 
The right and title to that privilege is yours , my friend . 
I haven 't done anything , but I can see you won 't believe that . 
I hope so . 
You said you love Buddie . 
For thine is the power and the glory forever and ever . 
Will you really take good care of him ? 
Good day . 
May he be happy and healthy . 
Help ... help ... help ... help ... ! 
Now , that ought to take care of everything , oughtn 't it ? 
- Well , they 're awfully good . 
Confidentially , honey , I 'm just a little short of terrific . 
That 's a friend of mine . 
I hope you 've learned your lesson , Jake . 
She won 't write any more . 
Papa will make it all better for you . 
Excuse my laughing , Michael . 
I 'd be delighted . 
Fine time for a wild old buzzard like you to turn moral . 
Won 't you drink with us , Your Highness ? 
I 'm really very nice . 
Such happiness was to be mine . 
I came in hopes of reaching an understanding . 
Play louder and listen carefully . 
Won 't you take off your hat ? 
Why , my darling ? 
- Good evening , Mr. Bratfisch . 
I 'll be free and we 'll be together always . 
You don 't know it , but it 's the most wonderful day of my life . 
" Happy souls are all the nicer to torment . " 
Yes , that 's what I was about to say . 
You know how he loved carnations . 
- Let 's hope so . 
Yes , it 's possible . 
Yes , they make me tickle all over . 
Here 's to love and money and flirting . 
When you come back , it 'll be better if I 'm not here . 
We all remember her devotion nursing him . 
You 'll join us later , when my parents have forgiven us . 
He has a good position . 
Your daughter has more courage than you . 
Can you give me a hand , please ? 
This love will not last … Marriage is not for you … 
- Good morning , Doctor . 
I 'm sure it 's nothing , don 't worry . 
Please , calm down , let me finish . 
- Yes , she did . 
If you want to tell me that you 're lovers , that 's no solution . 
- Yes , I understand . 
Lot of people are very nice in Brighton . 
That is funny , Jeeves . 
That won 't be at all necessary . 
- I 'm doing this for your own good . 
Good- bye . 
- If you insist , I 'm only too glad to help . 
We 'll take care of Mr. Wooster after we 've got the girl . 
I say , handle her with care . 
This girl is not a thief . 
Marjorie , I was just having the most beautiful dream about you .

What is good for hangovers ? 
- The best cure for it is to drink more . 
You 'd better go ! 
No , she 's well fixed up ... better than she was with me . 
I hoped to do better , get you a camera .. 
This isn 't a good night to attract attention . 
I won Paris- Le Havre amateur division , 17 years ago . 
But I feel like kissing you . 
He 's a good guy . 
He liked you a lot . 
Friends are worth more than you . 
When you return in a good mood , I know why and I feel like ... 
It 's nice of you to come .

She wouldn 't let me help her . 
Well , that 's very nice .

But , oh , to be free . 
I can 't make anybody fall in love , remember ? 
Abu , you look good . 
Yes . 
I can 't help unless you make a wish . 
I should have freed the genie when I had the chance . 
I 'll teach you some respect . 
You 've still got one wish left . 
On the contrary , I sometimes find it a great advantage . 
That 's so true .

There 's a funny thing about that . 
I see 'd he was just a- funning , and so I said to him , I said : 
Well , so much the better . 
But you could do me one great favor before I go . 
- We 're lucky we got ringside seats . 
Won 't we , Duke ? 
I 've formed a theory about that that would interest you .

I never stabbed you in the back , Chandler , and I want ... 
A fine friend you are . 
Connie , darling ! 
He 's the best- informed man on angling I 've ever met . 
Nine- tenths of the fun is reeling him in . 
I love it . 
It was just my way of saying I hope we can be friends . 
You 've taken a great load off my mind .

More than I ever dreamed I could care for anyone .

He 's a healthy brat . 
A good king is a merciful king . 
A windfall from heaven , I calls it . 
And Norfolk has virtue . 
But they won 't be judged by the Howards . 
And whose chief ambition is to build a safe nest in the throne . 
Maybe this will teach you respect for His Majesty 's Guard . 
But soon you 'll be sharing it with the worms . 
Yes , sir . 
Preaching the gospel means wearing funny hats . 
Good morning , Your Majesty . 
Which man did you wrongly but affectionately call uncle ?

Hey , why don 't you treat this as an official expense ? 
Good , I will give you a reasonable account . 
I 'm begging you for a favour , okay ? 
You don 't have to pretend to be a good guy ! 
You won 't be able to escape !

Wow ! 
Don 't save me ! 
You won 't be able to drag me out ! 
Save me ...

Good dog ...

Don 't you care about me any more ?

Have you send the message clearly ? 
What a good wine 
White- faced Chiu , Siu Lu the Magnificent 
I will live and glorify my name 
If I could save a dying man with a needle 
Does that make you equally happy ? 
And enjoy ourselves 
I 'd sure like to see that 
You should treat her well 
Yes , for that young swordsman 
Is it true only the cold and merciless 
And do anything to succeed ? 
What you lose is more valuable than what is gained ? 
Maybe one day in future ... you will find it useful 
So you want to be a hero ? 
It 's good to drink wine . 
Who over there could be so ecstatic ? 
Help ! 
Is it true ? 
Not good enough ? 
It is indeed very powerful ! 
Very powerful , right ? 
Don 't be so proud 
I 'll teach them a good lesson ! 
This is so wonderful ! 
No wonder you can 't win over him ! 
Please use us as you see fit ! 
Y es , oh yes !

My nice , fresh salami .

You might as well save your breath .

Good afternoon . 
Yes , sir ? 
Yes , sir ? 
Cheer up , Ebenezer . 
Perhaps you feel you 'd like to repay his kindness to you . 
I wouldn 't touch your old hand . 
But , darling , just one slide .

I won 't go with you . 
Thank you , dear .

Joon- ha ! 
But you 're still pretty 
That necklace was a gift from my dad 
Both of them really love each other 
Good idea 
Sang- min , I wasn 't acting it was my true feelings 
Thanks . 
But they 're only his first gift 
I love you , Genji 
Yes . 
I won 't go to America 
I 'm glad you could come . 
He came for my help 
He 's not as bad as you 
But do me a favor 
Most of my friends left and joined gangs 
But I do love you so much 
For the sake of samurai justice 
Good work , men 
He was my childhood friend 
Why don 't you help Genji ? 
LOVE YOUR NElGHBOUR . 
Great idea ! 
Very funny 
Good . 
We don 't care ! 
Yes . 
Give me a hand , will you ? 
How can you say it 's safe ? 
Yes . 
Tell me how you fell from grace . 
You 're very beautiful , Angela . 
You won 't change a thing tonight . 
Yes . 
Oh , yes . 
Taking advantage of my sweet nature , huh ? 
You wear these good- Iooking clothes just for business reasons . 
If you can find talent in the Navy , you can find it anywhere . 
Yes . 
Gosh , it 's so good to see you . 
Anyway , how come there aren 't any pretty girls to look at ? 
And I pocket 1 Won for each ice bar ! 
I won 't tell anyone . 
You dare grab my hand ? 
It tastes so good , Young- rae ! 
And it just makes me happy hearing that I have a dad . 
Even if you find your dad , he won 't be the dad you want . 
How much do you want to profit by bruising a child 's shoulder ? 
Oh goodness ! 
De Lautruc 's an old hand . 
Best man I ever knew . 
- Yes , ma 'am . 
Dr. Livingstone , he had him an elegant name for it : 
I hoped you 'd like it . 
- Good night , Mr. Cantrell . 
Won 't go anyplace where there 's company . 
I guess it 's pretty serious . 
- We 're all very fortunate to be up here . 
Because of its strangeness and beauty , I suppose . 
Julie , you 're lovely . 
That 's a right nice little Yankee . 
What good does that do ? 
Doctor says you better come right down . 
- Buck , you surely don 't mean to ... 
Buck has offered twice to accept an apology . 
I never saw a man die before . 
You 'd better get yourself some sleep . 
You won 't say anything , will you ? 
Cousin ... ... this is kind . 
I 'm glad I arrived in time to save something , madame . 
Monsieur , my lvanovitch , my Cossack hero , speak .

They 're much better than before I married them . 
And I wish you lots of luck . 
Very nice of you . 
Why aren 't you nice to me ? 
I don 't pay any dividends , and I 'm proud of it .

We 've had our love . 
You 'll sleep better . 
I gave him hope .

Manolo , darling . 
Don 't spoil her party . 
It won 't jam , will it ? 
I can 't love you more deeply . 
We 've had our love . 
I wouldn 't have hoped for happiness . 
You 'll see , it 'll be wonderful . 
My happiest day was a boat trip . 
In four days , more like . 
Out there , we 'll be free . 
We 're friends . 
- Yes , and afterwards . 
You can 't always win . 
Freedom did . 
You 'll sleep better . 
Now now , take it easy . 
We won 't go to Port Said . 
You were quite an impressive sight . 
Anyway , he 's a good man . 
I gave him hope .

Any transnational corporation will go for profits . 
Our peaceful little society . 
How would it help her ? 
Good- bye . 
His Majesty knows better than that , don 't ya , Rajah ? 
Very interesting . 
Not while I 'm with you , darling . 
What do you think of my party ? 
The day of deliverance is at hand ! 
We shall save that for this infidel . 
They won 't fit these guns . 
A friend of mine has replaced him . 
The technique and treatment are definitely his . 
- Is this true ? 
Most interesting . 
Very interesting for a Japanese fellow . 
Well , yes , as a matter of fact , he is . 
Yes , sir . 
Well , I can only hope you 're right .

You 've made this my happiest day . 
I won 't be Ionely anymore . 
I wish I were younger , my boy . 
You know , I really think I 'll enjoy working here . 
You seem to have a strong sympathy for Oscar . 
They don 't know that love never comes twice . 
We thought we 'd worked it out rather cleverly . 
Did you have a good time all by yourself ? 
Now that you 're all doing so well , 
Then Jane is what you might call a wise investment . 
Perhaps we 'd better dance .

I hope she gets home all right . 
' We thank you very sweetly 
' That we thank you very sweetly 
Well , my little pretty , I can cause accidents , too ! 
' I would dance and be merry Life would be a ding- a- derry 
Yes , that 's true , 
I haven 't any courage at all , 
Don 't you think the Wizard could help him , too ? 
I 'll take care of you now instead of later ! 
Here , Tin Man , help me , 
Don 't you know the Wizard will give you some courage ? 
No , my dear , I 'm a very good man , 
I won 't let you take him ! 
I hope she gets home all right . 
The Munchkins are happy . 
" We thank you very sweetly

Here , Tin Man , help me . 
Don 't you know the Wizard will give you some courage ? 
It 's true , the others are still alive . 
This was going to be my best story yet ! 
They 're a pretty good bunch . 
Alright ... ready the sails ! 
Yes , really ? 
Come on , relax ! 
The engine won 't start ! 
I came over here to help you . 
Start walking down the deck and don 't try anything funny . 
You should consider yourself fortunate . 
Then what makes him a better man ? 
I imagine Dr. Canavan saved your life . 
I wish there were . 
That 's better than rotting away in an officer 's club . 
Dying is easy . 
Yes , I know .

Jacques , are you free tomorrow afternoon ? 
Your chauffeur took care of that , Madame . 
I won 't play . 
Who won ? 
We 're having a weekend party at our place in Versailles . 
And good men so scarce . 
Fun , isn 't it ? 
Oh , my soul , this is heaven . 
Remember our honeymoon in Copenhagen , darling ? 
Heaven forgive me . 
Good night . 
I suppose love is safer in a place like this . 
Oh , yes . 
Thank you , Your Honor . 
Better sit down . 
" Therefore , I beseech the Blessed Mary , ever Virgin ... 
Let the Yankees ask for peace ! 
Oh , I could never hate you , and I know you must care about me . 
Scarlett 's just high- spirited and vivacious . 
Miss O 'Hara , I told you I loved you . 
Yes , Captain Butler , I remember you . 
I wish you 'd go away . 
But I expect a very fancy profit out of it . 
You do waltz divinely , Captain Butler . 
Ashley 's safe . 
What luck ! 
I wish I could get out of here . 
lf only I hadn 't promised Ashley ! 
Now blow your nose like a good little girl . 
Have you the strength to put your arms around my neck ? 
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you ! 
Mother 'll take care of him when we get home . 
I won 't think about that now . 
- Yes . 
He has finally asked for Suellen 's hand . 
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits . 
You 'd have done better than General Grant with far less effort . 
But that 's part of your charm . 
I don 't care what you say , only give me the money . 
I thought surely she had written you . 
lf we just give Gallegher a free hand -- 
Look at all our friends . 
There 's nothing much that money won 't buy . 
Nobody cares about me . 
We thought it best not to tell you , Scarlett . 
lf you 'll give me your word , I won 't search the house . 
Yes , I did ! 
Would you be more convinced if I fell to my knees ? 
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you . 
Do you mean to say you don 't care ? 
I won 't let on . 
I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth . 
" For he 's a jolly good fellow .... " 
" For he 's a jolly good fellow For he 's a jolly good fellow 
You know I 've always admired your spirit , my dear . 
Good night ! 
Yes , I suppose I am . 
- Oh , my darling . 
ls she better ? 
Scarlett loves you a great deal , much more than she knows . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Hallelujah . 
That makes it nice for you , doesn 't it ? 
You certainly gave a good imitation of it , up till this morning . 
Good night , Mr. Wilkerson . 
I could never hate you , and I know you must care about me . 
Your secret is safe with me . 
Scarlett 's just high- spirited and vivacious .

- Ashley 's safe . 
Ashley 's still alive to come home to the women who love him . 
Ashley , tell me you love me . 
What luck ! 
I wish I could get out of here . 
Now blow your nose like a good little girl . 
Better get out of here fast . 
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you . 
Mother will take care of him when we get home . 
I won 't think about that now . 
Yes , Scarlett , I 'm coming .

We 'll wait outside till he and his friends return . 
You look healthy . 
Yes , I did . 
Would you be convinced if I fell to my knees ? 
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you . 
You don 't care ? 
I don 't care what she 's done to you . 
She has such a beautiful mouth . 
You 're going to that party and you 'll have to hurry . 
I won 't go ! 
You know , I 've always admired your spirit , my dear . 
Good night . 
Yes , I suppose I am . 
ls she better ? 
Scarlett loves you a great deal . 
I 've never before known anyone who was really brave . 
That makes it nice for you , doesn 't it ? 
You certainly gave a good imitation of it , up to this morning . 
She was so like you .

" Therefore , I beseech the Blessed Mary , ever Virgin ... 
He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy ! 
Let the Yankees ask for peace ! 
Oh , I could never hate you , and I know you must care about me . 
Scarlett 's just high- spirited and vivacious . 
Miss O 'Hara , I told you I loved you . 
Yes , Capt. Butler , I remember you . 
I wish you 'd go away . 
But I expect a very fancy profit out of it . 
You do waltz divinely , Capt. Butler . 
Ashley 's safe . 
Ashley , tell me you love me . 
What luck ! 
I wish I could get out of here . 
If only I hadn 't promised Ashley ! 
Now blow your nose like a good little girl . 
Have you the strength to put your arms around my neck ? 
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you ! 
Mother will take care of him when we get home . 
I won 't think about that now . 
- Yes . 
He 's finally asked for Suellen 's hand . 
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits . 
You 'd have done better than Gen. Grant with far less effort . 
But that 's part of your charm . 
I don 't care what you say , only give me the money . 
I thought surely she had written you . 
If we just give Gallagher a free hand ... 
Look at all our friends . 
There 's nothing much that money won 't buy . 
Nobody cares about me . 
We thought it best not to tell you . 
If you 'll give me your word , I won 't search the house . 
Yes , I did . 
Would you be more convinced if I fell to my knees ? 
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you . 
Do you mean to say you don 't care ? 
I won 't let on . 
I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth . 
You know I 've always admired your spirit , my dear . 
Good night ! 
Yes , I suppose I am . 
- Oh , my darling . 
Is she better ? 
Scarlett loves you a great deal , much more than she knows . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Hallelujah . 
That makes it nice for you , doesn 't it ? 
You certainly gave a good imitation of it , up till this morning . 
I hoped against hope that you 'd call for me , but you didn 't . 
Would you be convinced if I fell to my knees ? 
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you . 
You don 't care ? 
I don 't care what she 's done to you . 
She has such a beautiful mouth . 
You 're going to that party and you 'll have to hurry . 
I won 't go ! 
You know , I 've always admired your spirit , my dear . 
Good night . 
Yes , I suppose I am . 
Is she better ? 
Scarlett loves you a great deal . 
I 've never before known anyone who was really brave . 
That makes it nice for you , doesn 't it ? 
You certainly gave a good imitation of it , up to this morning . 
She was so like you . 
Isn 't it exciting , Scarlett ? 
Good night , Mr. Wilkerson .

Ashley 's still alive to come home to the women who love him . 
Ashley , tell me you love me .

I wish I could get out of here . 
Now blow your nose like a good little girl . 
Better get out of here fast . 
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you . 
Mother will take care of him when we get home . 
I won 't think about that now . 
Yes , Scarlett , I 'm coming . 
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits . 
You 'd done better than Grant , with far less effort . 
I don 't care what you say , only give me the money . 
I thought surely she had written you . 
Look at all our friends . 
Nobody cares about me . 
Ever since I took Charles away , though she won 't admit it . 
If you give me your word , I won 't search the house . 
We 'll wait outside till he and his friends return . 
You look healthy . 
Yes , I did .

Now blow your nose like a good little girl . 
Better get out of here fast . 
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you . 
Mother will take care of him when we get home . 
I won 't think about that now . 
Yes , Scarlett , I 'm coming . 
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits . 
You 'd done better than Grant , with far less effort . 
I don 't care what you say , only give me the money . 
I thought surely she had written you . 
Look at all our friends . 
Nobody cares about me . 
Ever since I took Charles away , though she won 't admit it . 
If you give me your word , I won 't search the house . 
We 'll wait outside till he and his friends return . 
You look healthy . 
Yes , I did . 
Would you be convinced if I fell to my knees ? 
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you . 
You don 't care ? 
I don 't care what she 's done to you . 
She has such a beautiful mouth . 
You 're going to that party and you 'll have to hurry . 
I won 't go ! 
You know , I 've always admired your spirit , my dear . 
Good night . 
Yes , I suppose I am . 
Is she better ? 
Scarlett loves you a great deal . 
I 've never before known anyone who was really brave . 
That makes it nice for you , doesn 't it ? 
You certainly gave a good imitation of it , up to this morning . 
She was so like you . 
" Therefore , I beseech the Blessed Mary , ever Virgin ... 
Let the Yankees ask for peace ! 
Oh , I could never hate you , and I know you must care about me . 
Scarlett 's just high- spirited and vivacious . 
Miss O 'Hara , I told you I loved you . 
Yes , Captain Butler , I remember you . 
I wish you 'd go away . 
But I expect a very fancy profit out of it . 
You do waltz divinely , Captain Butler . 
Ashley 's safe . 
What luck ! 
I wish I could get out of here . 
lf only I hadn 't promised Ashley ! 
Now blow your nose like a good little girl . 
Have you the strength to put your arms around my neck ? 
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you ! 
Mother 'll take care of him when we get home . 
I won 't think about that now . 
- Yes . 
He has finally asked for Suellen 's hand . 
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits . 
You 'd have done better than General Grant with far less effort . 
But that 's part of your charm . 
I don 't care what you say , only give me the money . 
I thought surely she had written you . 
lf we just give Gallegher a free hand -- 
Look at all our friends . 
There 's nothing much that money won 't buy . 
Nobody cares about me . 
We thought it best not to tell you , Scarlett . 
lf you 'll give me your word , I won 't search the house . 
Yes , I did ! 
Would you be more convinced if I fell to my knees ? 
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you . 
Do you mean to say you don 't care ? 
I won 't let on . 
I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth . 
" For he 's a jolly good fellow .... " 
" For he 's a jolly good fellow For he 's a jolly good fellow 
You know I 've always admired your spirit , my dear . 
Good night ! 
Yes , I suppose I am . 
- Oh , my darling . 
ls she better ? 
Scarlett loves you a great deal , much more than she knows . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Hallelujah . 
That makes it nice for you , doesn 't it ? 
You certainly gave a good imitation of it , up till this morning . 
Isn’ t it exciting , Scarlett ? 
Good night , Mr. Wilkerson . 
I could never hate you , and I know you must care about me . 
Your secret is safe with me . 
Scarlett 's just high- spirited and vivacious . 
Miss O 'Hara , I told you I loved you . 
Yes , Captain Butler , I remember you . 
I wish you 'd go away ! 
But I 'm sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to - 
I expect a very fancy profit out of it . 
You do waltz divinely , Captain Butler . 
- Ashley 's safe . 
Ashley 's still alive to come home to the women who love him . 
You will take good care of it , won 't you ? 
Ashley , tell me you love me . 
What luck ! 
I wish I could get out of here . 
Now blow your nose like a good little girl .

Well , he 's in a favorable situation . 
But it 's still nice ... 
I hope that this won 't cause a big problem . 
I won 't read it . 
She won 't become beef ! 
He 's really funny . 
Give a nice speech . 
But he was gracious in the end .

So - au revoir , and good luck . 
- I 'm so happy , dear ! 
You know that Kristian 's adventures were quite innocent . 
- Wonderful . 
Like you 're faking all your other love scenes ! 
But in a way , it 's a very good thing you found out . 
Thanks , Phoebe . 
It won 't cost you an extra nickel . 
Oh , I say this is so exciting . 
Won 't you let me give you a lift ? 
- Yes . 
Oh , wonderful ! 
Congratulations . 
If you 're coming to the show , you 'd better get changed . 
I do cherish a fellow feeling for you .

- Good morning . 
- Good morning , I am covered by the health insurance here . 
- And how did my sweetheart sleep ? 
And they 're not even ashamed ! 
- That 's perfectly fine . 
And those doctors don 't help you ? 
Drive you , like this ! 
- Mr Head Surgeon is very kind . 
So , my friend , to your health ! 
My head 's ringing like a belltower ! 
- Like the blazes ! 
I don 't care , as long as he 's there when I get there . 
He has better taste than most people . 
Having a good time ? 
It won 't happen again . 
I 'm quite comfortable , thank you . 
That 's interesting too . 
Now , now , sweetheart , that 's no way to talk . 
You 'll make a very good soldier . 
I guess that ain 't very interesting . 
Darling , we said we wouldn 't talk about it tonight . 
Ready ... camera ... action ! 
You 'd better get dressed . 
I 'm quite comfortable , thank you . 
That 's interesting too .

You 'd better get dressed . 
And I can 't help . 
- Yes . 
That 's funny , isn 't it ? 
I won 't . 
Tim can take care of himself . 
I won 't have any more talk like this . 
- Just what 's the best way over to Tedford ? 
They 'll prove he 's a rat that don 't deserve better . 
We won 't be back . 
And I can 't help . 
- Yes .

But heaven will protect 
Without even saying good- bye . 
- I don 't like you either ! 
- That 's just their way of having fun . 
See that Curly Bill takes care of Earp . 
- I won 't be around long . 
You and your friends better come out and surrender peacefully . 
We 'd be perfect together , you and me . 
They look pretty tough , don 't they ? 
They 're all too much well prepared . 
You don 't know who the great Mr. Achille Weber is , do you ? 
That will be exciting to see . 
And you promoted it . 
I amuse myself by studying the faces of the people I see . 
But then an American cruiser rescued me . 
In Romania they thought I was pretty good . 
She sounds fascinating . 
Oh , dear ! 
But you can trust him . 
It will be thrilling for us if they do , Dumpsty . 
We 'd be perfect together , you and me .

The percentage is all in our favor . 
Hand it over so I can put it back 
I got away clean , nobody saw me . 
Maybe you 'd feel better if Madge came up 
Then I 'm clean . 
Yes , Johnnie . 
You gotta help me ! 
I had to get a couple of men to help him upstairs . 
I 'm taking care of you . 
Yes . 
That 's taken care of . 
What a splendid fellow he was . 
May he rest in peace . 
I 'll help you to the cart . 
Yes . 
- Yes , sir . 
- Yes , I 'm afraid he is . 
Ł1 million is a great temptation . 
- Yes . 
Good morning . 
This is my most remarkable find so far . 
Yes , sir . 
I 'd be delighted . 
- It 's perfectly all right . 
Clever , very clever ! 
Good morning . 
This is my most remarkable find so far . 
Yes , sir . 
I 'd be delighted . 
- It 's perfectly all right . 
Clever , very clever ! 
- Yeah , yeah . 
Go clean the animals ! 
It won 't wait till tomorrow , not even till later . 
See , you have an egg for tomorrow , you smart girl . 
Against me , Angel from Heaven , 
Ours is good enough . 
You should wise up , that way we would both win . 
My mother sang the fado Trying to make me feel better 
We 'd better laugh 
A love like the love of a woman 
You 're a great woman . 
When it comes to cars and women we have to be able to trust them . 
Uncle Jacinto is the best ! 
- I think you 're wonderful . 
You better come with us . 
That won 't be necessary , John . 
He 's doing the best he can . 
This will bring him pretty quick . 
You better get out of the dampness , my friend . 
He 's too smart for that . 
His friend Goliath . 
We 'll be very happy together , if my back holds out . 
The entertainment is right on tap . 
He did you a favor . 
I 'll save you . 
That won 't be necessary , John . 
He 's doing the best he can . 
This will bring him pretty quick .

I 'll save you . 
Well , somebody had to take care of him . 
" Generous reward . " Oh , boy ! 
Good old Porky . 
That won 't be necessary , John . 
He 's doing the best he can . 
This will bring him pretty quick . 
But isn 't it good ? 
But isn 't it good ? 
You better get out of the dampness , my friend . 
And proudly above Waves the red , white , and blue 
He 's too smart for that . 
His friend Goliath . 
We 'll be very happy together , if my back holds out . 
But isn 't it good ? 
The entertainment is right on tap . 
He did you a favor . 
I 'll save you . 
I think you 're going to be someone 's pretty wife . 
He 's always liked studying . 
I appreciate that , Sid . 
Easy . 
- Yes . 
I 'm not insulting you ! 
- I won 't . 
Who is this Uncle Henri that Pierre seems so fond of ? 
- Isn 't it nice here ? 
- Your 35 grand and the Canadian - Yes ? 
Don 't look at me like that ! 
Be ready tomorrow night , and you better shape up ! 
You have to be brave in life . 
- It won 't be for very long . 
I don 't have the strength . 
- Yes . 
I 'm not insulting you ! 
- I won 't . 
- Your 35 grand and the Canadian - Yes ? 
Don 't look at me like that ! 
Be ready tomorrow night , and you better shape up !

I don 't have the strength . 
And judging by his past , shall we say , successes ... 
Can 't do you any good . 
He 's not dead . 
Yes , Mulligan and Garrity ! 
You 're safe with me . 
It 's fortunate she wasn 't , sir . 
Yes , I did . 
- Good evening , Judge . 
- Yes , Dr. Savaard . 
What a funny guy ! 
How dare you raise a hand to your brother . 
I 'd love to have him spank me . 
So you , too , love him ? 
Can 't he see I love him so much . 
I think it is either reassuring . 
Have you already promised her hand ? 
Is that true ? 
So you saved her life . 
Yes ? 
I had only one hope , and was ready to do anything to fulfill it . 
She hasn 't said this about Miura , so there 's hope ! 
Now your handsome face is scarred . 
Today is a happy day . 
Now that I know the truth , my heart is singing with joy . 
I cannot marry a woman who wouldn 't trust my love vows . 
I wish you 'd told me earlier . 
Don 't talk to me like that ! 
Relax ! 
Tony has made all my girlfriends happy ! my clothes .. 
You certainly aren 't ! 
Darling , what are you doing ? 
Well , I like it . 
Are you happy now ? 
Well , nice , leaving like this . 
Hopeful it should be , do you understand me ? 
Yes .. that 's a nice dress you 're wearing there , 
I am gonna kiss you ! 
Yes , sir . 
Very interesting story . 
And with me it 's gonna be good . 
If you came to help - then you 'll be our comrades . 
Cheers ! 
I kissed countesses ! 
Save my wife doctor ! 
Honestly , I do understand their actions . 
We 're peaceful Russians . 
- You most certainly have , Captain Crew . 
I should hope so . 
But he 's not dead . 
There won 't be any worms for you this morning . 
- Oh my goodness . 
- Come on Becky , give me your hand . 
He may be with the new wounded men , but they won 't let me look . 
- We must be good soldiers you know . 
- Yes , I was joking . 
Okay , okay , let 's not get off topic , Mr. Zecchi . 
- Thanks , you 're a real friend . 
I liked you more when you were doing the mannequins . 
Yes ! 
I 'm in love with her . 
- Maybe , but she doesn 't seem like the type . 
- Yes , I spent 2 hours looking for them . 
If we don 't help each other ... 
I 'm sure everything will be fine . 
He 's a good guy , Bruno , you know ? 
Congratulations . 
Trust me , I didn 't take those socks . 
A young girl , pretty , intelligent like yourself ... 
- It 's better if you sit down . 
- Yes , inside ... 
But your individual marks are so good . 
Well , then fine . 
What was good about him ? 
She 's so active for a girl . 
- Yes . 
I 'm just glad I was able to have a good child . 
That 's more than enough , thank you . 
It 's OK . 
Tell me , or I won 't give them back . 
- It has to be perfect ... 
I can 't help thinking of that on December 31 . 
I won 't wait for the cart . 
I don 't understand why you show an interest in him . 
We 're here to comfort him , to help him and his family . 
Keep him for your army if you 're interested . 
I wanted to try to be smart . 
You love a scoundrel . 
I’ d like to tell you , you saved my life . 
What a slap in my face for my good intentions . 
I promise the good life will start again . 
How beautiful she is .

Like the lilies of the field , my friend . 
There is a better way . 
Good enough to take a man anywhere he wants to go . 
You have to save him . 
Yes , well go and clean yourself up .

He was such a good police dog . 
That was not murder , woman . 
Eden , beyond infinity and glory ... ... of the unknowable . 
I 'II help you . 
A kiss per day is not even minimum wage . 
Do you mean that in a friendly way ? 
Such great timing . 
My finances have taken a turn for the better . 
Besides ... ... he did help me out for now . 
- Maybe I 'II get better . 
Feel free to tell me anything .

I really like living the good life in this home . 
- I hope so .

Now , if I say yes , do I have to sign ?

Mr. district attorney , please let the defense finish . 
That man is innocent ! 
You can 't do that , Your Honor . 
But I do care for you . 
Nice chassis , huh , Joe ? 
It all depends on how smart the dame is . 
- We don 't have to be , but it 's more fun . 
Maybe if you had someone to help you ... 
- What 's the matter , you stop loving me ? 
Yes , sir ! 
Now , how about that drink to celebrate , just this once ? 
- Got to clean and adjust the points . 
- You better relax .

Yeah , that 's good . 
Gentle , harmless Adam . 
If married people can 't be honest with each other , who can ? 
Does that help any ? 
Well , I 'm glad for once it 's someone from another ship . 
Clear out ! 
A great , big dynamite bomb ! 
For your own safety . 
The sooner , the better .

- You 're not hurt ? 
Never mind the noble gestures .

You 'll see we have plenty to be thankful for .

- You 're a very lucky girl , my dear . 
You 're very lucky . 
I won 't be there at 11 : 00 , Mr. Sage , or ever .

He 's a great guy , in spots .

- I wonder if he knows how lucky he is . 
No feeling whatever for romance . 
But I 'm not hurt . 
We need aircraft help . 
I 'm much better now . 
It 's a long time since i had a good night 's sleep . 
- it won 't happen again . 
Great going . 
[ Laughing ] 
That 's more like you . 
What a charming smile . 
I am not going to kill myself . 
That 's the thanks I get . 
Your French is as good as mine . 
Mmm , and apparently with good cause . 
- Good heavens ! 
How wonderful she is , now that it is too late . 
I won 't . 
Maybe you 'd better take me in your arms . 
I can take care of him . 
Boil some water and get some clean rags . 
And Pete , without no brains and no hope . 
You can 't rest her easy by killin ' strangers . 
You won 't be . 
Sammy , it 's good to see you here . 
I won 't let him do that . 
Thanks . 
There ain 't nothin ' but good !

You promised you wouldn 't go to the ranch anymore ! 
If I do , please forgive me . 
- God give you a good evening , Senor Engineer . 
I 'm gonna save this . 
Was she pretty ? 
- I hope you feel better soon . 
Would you like to play chess ? 
Well , I 'll thank you to mind your own business .

- Yes ! 
It was my liberty against your appetite . 
But , darling , we 're only getting married . 
Well , we 'd surely like to have you . 
I don 't care if you whistle it , as long as it 's legal . 
I 'll take care of you on my broadcast .

Sit down , won 't you ? 
She cried for help , Larry and Bela went to her rescue . 
Surely a wound can 't heaI overnight . 
Now you wiII find peace . 
And I 'm sure that nothing but harm wiII come to you through him . 
- Yes . 
Now you wiII find peace for eternity . 
Sit down , won 't you ?

Yes , sirree . 
Sounds as pretty as it did this morning . 
Them yams smell good , don 't they ? 
Well , maybe things will be better over there . 
She 's pretty . 
Well , I just simply couldn 't live like that , that 's all .

I suppose Dr. Schickel 's examination isn 't good enough . 
You won 't find any blood . 
Nothing a year in the Army won 't cure . 
We enlisted to see that he got proper care . 
- Thanks . 
- I hope not . 
Always glad to do a favor for a pal . 
Nothing to laugh at . 
Pleased to meet ...

You were glad to get rid of me ! 
Oh , thanks . 
Oh , my goodness , you are ! 
All I have to buy are my underthings , thank heaven . 
That 's good . 
- Oh , but not that badly , honey- cake . 
- I had to set them free . 
- Yes , I do hear voices . 
They were just fun ! 
Young lady , I can take care of myself . 
- Won 't you sit down ? 
- Stephen , darling . 
I 'm going to spread you around like warm butter . 
Oh , that 's lovely , dear . 
- But I said , " Not so lovely , " dear . 
A couple of you boys better search the bedroom and the terrace . 
I 'm always happy to meet friends of my brother , Stephen 's . 
- Take it easy !

The three of us are all strong enough to pass ! 
Great God of Thunder ! 
I still have something I need you to help me with . 
You love another woman . 
We have heard the order of Master , to seek happiness for all .

Great town , Johannesburg . 
Oh , you 're a great little kidder . 
Just a minute , friend . 
Donna , that 's my friend . 
Nice out . 
Ha , ha , ha . 
But outside of that it 's peaceful 
You kiss me with your eyes 
My heart gets so excited 
Fearless Frazier , the great profile . 
Then I send my congratulations . 
Yes . 
- Good- bye . 
- Good- bye . 
- Good night . 
It was my pleasure . 
- Still the silly hand . 
Such patients are often euphoric to the last moment . 
Everything beautiful in life , nothing will be spared ! 
- Yes . 
Is nice of you to always come yourself . 
Surely , you 're not that sick . 
- Not my business , but you have good taste . 
- Yes . 
So happy . 
How I love you , Thomas . 
Set her free . 
Yes , of course . 
But otherwise , he had faithfully served me his entire life . 
Yes , Thomas . 
Surely , this cannot have changed since then . 
I won 't have any part ... 
- Sure he never harmed a person in his ... 
All he did was hold up his hand like this : 
But , I 'm sure you 'd find it more profitable to remain . 
If she 's one of this mob , why did she help us ? 
There 's my picture , one of my best . 
Sunshine 's doing all the interviewing . 
- You 're not afraid to die ? 
I 'd never die without letting you know . 
Yes ! 
Larry , you asked me to help you towards a new way of life . 
Good morning . 
I love them . 
I won 't be sarcastic if you won 't be patronizing . 
You are very clever to have guessed it . 
As Ms. Vaughan says so beautifully in her play : 
Good . 
Oh , well , anyway , Karin is good . 
Yes , like you . 
That was my ideal . 
You were doing pretty well . 
Didn 't being with your friends help a little ? 
Yes , the more I think of it , the more I like it . 
Yes , signing too many autographs . 
I 'm in favor of that part of it . 
She 's got a nice , honest face . 
Yes , sir , I think she 's the answer to a conscriptee 's prayer . 
It 's nice of you to come over . 
Yeah , well , is everything set , Stevie ? 
You were perfectly justified . 
All you have to do is be a good soldier . 
Of course I 'm not a coward ! 
You can 't help it if you 're a public figure . 
I hope you haven 't kept up the payments . 
Thanks , buddy . 
Yes . 
- Now , Anna , a little milk of human kind ... 
My father had a brilliant mind , I am told , too brilliant . 
You might just be some kindly deity 's answer to my prayer . 
- Admit the truth . 
Remember , she and Lars- Erik are engaged to be married . 
It wasn 't love , I ... 
You should love your fellow man , you . 
Yes .

The sport is in the chase , not the kill . 
She won 't do anything I ask her to . 
Against every decent , peaceful person in the world ! 
Perhaps you haven 't made such a good bargain after all . 
I can offer you a new life and a far more exciting one . 
There 's just as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it . 
Good gracious . 
Her Majesty is pleased to be with her children this hour . 
" I have the honour to be etc , etc , etc . " 
You must please forgive me if I seem a little abrupt . 
I took the liberty of seeing the Queen . 
Well , for heaven 's sake ... .. where is the doctor ? 
You mustn 't excite yourself . 
Lord Nelson in a good mood . 
I 'm convinced he was only thinking of your career . 
Oh , my darling . 
To leave a lass I love so fond and true ( Bell rings ) 
But we 've still got the courage to face it . 
Yes , that is what I am without her . 
And how proud I might have been . 
It 's a glorious victory ! 
I shall be rich . 
Why do you make fun of me ? 
Why doesn 't Hardy come ? 
( Softly ) It 's all over now , Hardy . 
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . 
The oceans are free once more and England is safe from invasion

I promise you , it isn 't like that . 
Ok , Miss Jones , then , if she likes it better that way . 
I play no favorites . 
I 've never written one as funny as this . 
Good night . 
Gee , you 're beautiful . 
Good enough for a kiss , anyway . 
There won 't be any more . 
Well , it is fairly important . 
Well , I can and it would be a pleasure . 
Come here , darling . 
Help me get into my things . 
You won 't have to anymore . 
Well , it is fairly important . 
Well , I can and it would be a pleasure . 
Come here , darling . 
Help me get into my things . 
You won 't have to anymore . 
And I 'm not whining . -- it 's been like this for four years . 
- Yes . 
Time will take care of that . 
Yes . 
- Oh , yes . 
Very good . 
Now he 's alive , you want both . 
Any man would find Sandra attractive . 
[ LAUGHS ] 
Lively isn ' t it ? 
Yes , he is . 
Was she beautiful ? 
All poetic illusion is as delicate as a dream , and as beautiful . 
Thank you for your help . 
Now that he ' s made it I ' m happy . 
Lively isn 't it ? 
Yes , he is . 
Was she beautiful ? 
All poetic illusion is as delicate as a dream , and as beautiful . 
Thank you for your help . 
Now that he 's made it I 'm happy . 
Yes , Governor . 
And when it goes , Good starts to shine ... ... as if by miracle . 
How beautiful ! 
What if someday he comes back to bring the peace ? 
Because you don 't know what love is . 
For Love ! 
Because they 're in love . 
Because he loves only me . 
You 're lucky that I can 't move . 
Look , Look , he 's alive ! 
It is easy to be good when you 're happy . 
To make justice . 
All you think of is laughter and booze . 
Because the tournament champion is with him . 
Honest , Father . 
- Thanks , Father . 
Any boy is free to leave here any time he wants to . 
They never do you any good . 
I want you to help me . 
He 'll be proud of you . 
He sure surprised me . 
Good night , Pee Wee . 
Amazing . 
- I won 't believe that . 
You must stay here and help wipe it out . 
Since he came home , he looks like he lost his best friend . 
We won 't get paid . 
Is there a good one ? 
But it 's nice to tell people about places along the way . 
" Sa " is strong . 
Yes . 
We won 't get paid .

Yes . 
You better take him to my room . 
Yes , we 're gonna make sure they take good care of you . 
I 'm trying to romance with you and what do I get ? 
Well , it certainly isn 't with Dr. Rigas . 
I was too late to help . 
He was kind and gentle and ... 
They can 't hold him legally responsible , can they ? 
Dan 's interests will be taken care of . 
Hard luck , like me . 
I congratulate you , Neighbor Stone . 
We 're rich . 
He just wants a little rest in the sunshine . 
Wouldn 't profit him none . 
But I may send a friend of mine , just for old times ' sake .

I happen to be entertaining Baron Emden . 
Parties , soirées , dressmakers and all that whoop- de- doodle ? 
Darling . 
But , dearest , if it takes 20 years ... 
Sweetheart . 
- Yes , ma 'am . 
And by " nice " ? 
Oh , my darling . 
We never think of money or success . 
Whereas your father must be fabulously wealthy . 
You don 't think I 'm mocking , my love , I hope . 
Cheer up , brother . 
Easy there , mate ! 
- Well , my dear . 
Ha ! 
Keeping you rich ! 
- Well , if you 're happy , why don 't you look happy , as we do ? 
You 're welcome to my secret , now I 've discovered yours . 
We know better than that . 
So I would , and often have cheerful ! 
Freedom should be generous . 
Glory , hallelujah .

Muriatic acid is used to clean algae off ship hulls .

In luck ? 
The last one here — Oh , a wise guy . 
Now , I 'm in a position to help you — 
Perhaps you could help us in some other way . 
" Lou was my first sweetheart , and she came between us . 
Why , Mike , I wouldn 't lie to a smart guy like you . 
Thought you were pretty smart , eh , Shayne ? 
I 'm gonna send you up for a nice , long stretch . 
- Yeah , thanks .

Look , Dumbo , I 'm your friend . 
Lord Asano sacrificed family honor . 
Your important duty 's to calm the people . 
We 're equally loyal ... not only you . 
Restoring his house is loyalty too . 
I can 't be reborn to be wise . 
It requires determination . 
I know you won 't back out . 
And for that reason he 's pretending to be like that . 
Well , well , I 'm glad you came . 
Even if Lord Uesugi helps him ... we won 't be afraid . 
We must respect the law . 
We are grateful we are ordered to hara- kiri .

Good morning . 
I hope you can understand my situation . 
- How interesting ! 
I 'm pleased with your keen perception . 
We can" t afford a special police force . 
We are a peaceful nation . 
That won" t help you much , father . 
You seem to care about England a lot . 
I love our fatherland just like you do . 
But India is rich ! 
Mr. President , the agreement is ready to be signed . 
Yes , dear Doctor , and I even admire him . 
You won" t be able to bribe him . 
We won" t be fobbed off like that . 
It" s a wonderful idea . 
It would mean the end of all our liberties ! 
Cronje asked Kitchener for free passage for them . 
You have to be very clever and very careful , my son . 
I think it 's outstanding ! 
If you don 't like the food here , go to the front ! 
Justice and freedom have been taken from us .

See how pretty she looks ?

But I got a good look at the house .

The bakers are protected by the Court of Provision .

Crying won 't help . 
- Yes . 
- No , you gave him the greatest happiness of his life . 
Never mind , I wish he would . 
Good night , madame . 
Yes 
And yet it was wonderful . 
You want a divorce , because you are in love . 
Then he said " yes " 
Quite certainly .

You with your legs like a colt and mine like a calf . 
- Are you really in love with this mug ? 
you succeeded handsomely . 
It 's perfectly simple . 
He certainly took some nice falls . 
But he won 't do it . 
Don 't you know you 're the only man I ever loved ?

Great , big , strapping man , too . 
Nothing like a good night 's sleep to pep you up . 
He won 't act like that again . 
I 'd be reinstated and get a medal besides . 
I wish I hadn 't . 
Why don 't you tell him to come down and surrender peaceably ?

- Good night . 
People ought to help other people . 
Instead you were having a holiday of thinking . 
This is a holiday . 
Mama told you it 's unwise for a good- looking woman to frown . 
But I must do what I think best . 
- Don 't you dare speak to me like this ! 
Maybe it 's easier for the dying to be honest . 
It just isn 't true . 
Then suddenly she laughed and said ... 
You get talking like this , and you 'll surely get a headache . 
It 's fine for you to tell me not to worry . 
Perhaps because I remember how much I was in love with you . 
Now you shall have the bonds safely back .

I want my regiment back , Grant . 
I won 't go .

Elephant better . 
Boy have good time . 
Little boys tell the most fantastic tales . 
Would you kindly give me a sip of cool water ? 
Now you won 't need any more medicine for a while .

We would be much better off ...

Couldn 't be better . 
You weren 't in good shape when you reported . 
Better not stay unsolved for long . 
He still has a fair chance for recovery .

He had the makings of a great pilot . 
Thanks . 
He 'll wish he 'd taken a cigarette case . 
- He 's in a very good mood for him . 
- Thanks . 
Now I 'd appreciate it if you 'd answer my question . 
Couldn 't be better . 
You weren 't in good shape when you reported . 
Better not stay unsolved for long . 
He still has a fair chance for recovery .

Get to work before I hand out a flock of suspensions ! 
He won 't get away . 
- Good luck , lieutenant . 
He never kept a horse from winning till they made him do it . 
See if I care . 
Very interesting , huh ? 
I 'd just love to see you catch those crooks . 
Say , did the Irish Thrush win ? 
Can you tell us when he left this nice peaceful world ? 
Well , this is one bet I 'll win . 
Will I be glad to tell that to those newshounds . 
Yes , he did . 
- Well , he had a reason and the chance . 
He 'd look good in the comics . 
- Good afternoon , Macy .

Take it easy . 
An animal that made everyone in the castle laugh . 
Kind sirs . 
I arranged these festivities to make you happy . 
You should still find me pretty , compared to them . 
Perhaps I didn 't love Baroness Berthe as in the songs . 
Surely the one he loved has left him , or perhaps he did . 
She loves him . 
How pretty she is now . 
You are lucky . 
You didn 't often give me reason to laugh ... 
My dear love . 
Others love us . 
Good night , Gilles . 
Best to speak of love during the day to such fresh creatures . 
Put your hand on my heart and feel how it beats . 
- How you must have loved her . 
We 'll have a great day . 
I do so like birds . 
Trust me ... 
But I love you . 
I 'm one of his friends . 
You are all the love in the world . 
Oh , the lovely fire ! 
- Oh , what do I care ? 
- Yes . 
Good idea . 
Gilles will never again be unhappy since we love each other . 
My life will not be in danger . 
I find it very amusing . 
You don 't want me to become as gentle as a suckling lamb ? 
You 're really set against making me happy . 
Memories are lovely things , but trust me , what 's past is past . 
Nice tournament , pretty women , lovely weather , noble lords ... 
- True . 
I love you . 
How can you be blamed for being beautiful and desirable ? 
Yes , dear sir . 
Don 't forget your promise , dear sir : 
Yet I love her . 
Truly the world is awry .

Ernest , thank goodness you stopped it . 
Oh , yes .

Time 's up , darling . 
I thought it would be fun . 
I wish you were coming along , Lucy .

The first good time I 've had in a month of Sundays . 
Oh , you 'll feel better in the morning . 
But this is something that 'll benefit all humanity . 
- Trying to be a hero , huh ? 
It won 't . 
Take it easy , Snip . 
And it won 't be long before half the state will believe it . 
It wouldn 't dare print that if it weren 't true . 
Clyde , is that true ? 
I 'm afraid it does , darling . 
- Ah , a wise guy . 
Thanks for giving me those bobs .

I 'll take care of this , son . 
It 's just a natural gift with him , like boxing . 
Has he ever pushed you off the flying rings , just playful like ? 
He won 't even lay a glove on me . 
- Feeling pretty good , aren 't you ? 
But I 'm afraid we 'll have to ask your friend here to leave . 
I 'm the champion of the world , I 'll have you know . 
That 's very funny .

I worked for your father , and I loved him . 
Because you 're bred true . 
[ Laughing ]

Put your hand beside you under your coat . 
Yeah , I should have known better . 
Perfectly true , milord . 
Not I , by my faith ! 
This horse back- breaker , this huge hill of flesh ! 
- I am glad you have the money . 
Good- night , my noble lord . 
I could have better spar 'd a better man . 
The better part of value is discretion . 
O love , how thou sweatest ! 
Kiss me , Doll . 
Thou art the most pleasant and raskal of a prince . 
How a good yoke of bullocks at the fair ? 
He drew a good bow . 
John of Gaunt loved him well and betted much money on him . 
Hast thou seen a good score of ewes ? 
His example may help others such as him .

The woman that I loved most dearly had a beard like that . 
Why did he pretend to free me ? 
Yours shall be swift and sure .

Can 't trust any of 'em an inch .

They were noble , we were rich , and that was that !

If you need help , just ask . 
But the mother superior wasn 't interested . 
And she won 't let you keep any other animals ? 
We 'll have to help him ourselves . 
We 'll take care of everything . 
We 'll never be apart again , my love . 
I don 't care . 
Nice idea !

To be saved , the Nation must have a new leader ! 
You must do what is necessary to save the country ! 
We shall be together forever . You won 't ever leave me again . 
Laugh it up , laugh it up ! 
No , please , don 't protect me anymore . 
At ease ! 
You were such good friend before . 
I don 't think it 's serious or honest to speak about marriage ... 
You can go as well , Mario , I 'm fine by myself .

- Nothing , leave me in peace . 
That 's great . 
He deserved better . 
You 're having dreams ? 
I hope this condition is only temporary . 
Please calm yourself . 
Come along if you like ... but spare me your sweet nothings . 
Good act , isn 't it ? 
Thank goodness . 
My plan was perfect ! 
My face is just as good as yours . 
It won 't have any effect on me .

She 's engaged to a marine .

- Would it help to talk them out ? 
- She thinks that l - - Yes , yes , I know . 
But it was her express wish that you were not to be sent for .

An honour to meet you , kid . 
I know you meant it for the best . 
You 're engaged to me and that 's it . 
Her skirts are clean . 
Two men telling us how to welcome a hero !

Kitty , congratulations from all of us . 
I don 't think I want to go through an interview like that again . 
It is such lovely women as you who drag men down . 
Oh , Jean , darling . 
Yes , I was a pilot in the Escadrille Lafayette . 
We 're all like that , Free Frenchmen . 
I thought it would be nice to drink together and talk about home . 
Have you the courage to beat the river and the sea ? 
Yes . 
Please , darling , if you love me . 
It was great , what you did . 
Yes , Jean .

This man , Wu Lien , loves his cash box above his country . 
- They are of my own kind . 
I love you more than I love my father and my mother . 
And one such an honest young man . 
They have no use to people like us who love only to live . 
Yes , my husband . 
My good red pigskin boxes ... ... that I brought here as a bride . 
If not my own , then one that I can trust . 
This is a time for joy . 
Shall I thank heaven for sending us back but one ? 
Heaven gave me the thought . 
You seem to love them more than you love your child . 
Do not waste your tears . 
He has been good to us . 
- Yes , great one . 
Where am I not in danger ? 
We know better . 
- He was so good . 
Yes , it is . 
I would not have killed him had I thought he would not . 
- Love my country ? 
Can a man love his country better than that ? 
Yes , but I know it well . 
Your third son because he has come to love it . 
I helped you dig once , now you help me . 
My sister will be safe and have food .

Wonderful moon . 
I took care of that little matter , boss . 
Good morning , Mr. Calhoun . 
Nobody better start picking on me . 
- That 's love , I say ... 
You want me to help you watch him , Marshal ? 
- Good morning . 
Yes , I know . 
I guess it 's better that they don 't know . 
We 're to stay here where we 're safe . 
But why good- bye ? 
Unable to send help . 
I love you , Commander . 
- Yes . 
Fine thing , a boy hoping his school has blown up . 
- Yes . 
Well , that would not kill the resemblance . 
- Yes , that 's perfect . 
The great Bonet , himself , announced that fact . 
- And that would have pleased you . 
There I was , free . 
Small , but very powerful . 
I saw his face very clearly in the moonlight . 
They breed ugly thoughts , but my people are at peace again . 
- I don 't care . 
I 'm not angry . 
- Yes . 
Somehow it 's always more beautiful just before dark . 
I threw it over my shoulder for luck . 
Miracle or no miracle, Jerry . 
I don 't care what they said about Curly . 
Can I help it if it moves around ? 
- Oh , yes , you will .

Amazing !

" Dear Mr. Brown , a matter of personal importance 
Well , I think everything is about ready , Doctor . 
Funniest thing I ever heard of . 
Please , darling . 
Barbara will love to have you . 
- Okay , my friend .

There 's hope . 
You treated Dad Hayden pretty roughly and you know it . 
And no matter what Dad thinks , I still love Dave . 
And I think she rather likes it that way . 
Yes . 
Better , I trust ? 
Yes ? 
Why , I loved that girl . 
But I believed if she did , it was to help me . 
Yes . 
Good night . 
Surely it isn 't just this Margaret Mercer business ? 
Not good , is it ? 
It is true ! 
Won 't you please try ? 
Will you help me ? 
Just like the dream I told her . 
Though our love has just begun 
Oh , thanks . 
I 'm so glad you could make it . 
But you know , if I 'd held this hand 10 years ago ... 
- Yes . 
- Yeah , isn 't that wonderful ? 
Merry Christmas , honey .

Please , please , please . 
For heaven 's sakes . 
- Yes , sir - Uh , ma 'am . 
I 'm a business girl on holiday .

- Aren 't you interested in t 'country ? 
You drop the pin in the well , and as it sinks , you make a wish . 
Oh , my darling . 
Every natural instinct is urging him to take this chance . 
Do you think I 'd help you to get him ? 
They won 't wait that long . 
This is a party . 
A silver sun burned through the sky like a huge magnifying glass . 
In my case , self- absorption is completely justified . 
It was a masterpiece because it was a labor oflove . 
- She 's got good sense too . 
I 'm not sick . 
I don 't care . 
You 'd better take off those wet clothes . 
- Yes . 
I 'm not doing it for fun . 
Well , you look very sweet . 
Yes . 
- Yes , I am .

That 's very much like justice , isn 't it ? 
Yes , yes , I robbed him . 
Yes , that 's why he wanted the money . 
I did not kill Konrad ! 
Very brilliant . 
But fascinating . 
It 's true .

Well , in that case , I can only humor you 
Half a million francs ... would be useful to you ? 
I wish to make restitution in a practical way . 
I have very good news for you . 
Yes , but Karel hasn 't won yet . 
We 'll win it again and more another time . 
I 'm sure they 'd be interested to know that it is the same man 
Can that be true ? 
I like to be fair ... always . 
Peters : are you satisfied , Dimitrios ?

Gabrielle , you did all that you could to save Eve . 
- Anne has done a good job , Mort . 
I can 't help it if I 'm metabolic , can l ? 
She isn 't strong and yet she seems healthy enough . 
- Why , darling . 
- You know , darling , you amuse me . 
You talk like a free soul , but you 're the most manacled creature 
I won 't be a moment . 
I enjoy it tremendously . 
Not at all , but I am a very good sculptor , Mrs. Crandall . 
On the contrary , I am fascinated . 
- Did you get the x- ray machine , Your Honor ? 
The only one I saw was of a much too high voltage to be safe . 
In fact , I wish you would . 
- Good . 
Only , oh , Mother , he 's just so wonderful ! 
This is fantastic ! 
That 's a lovely idea , darling . 
She won 't let me eat anything .

Well , to begin with , your brother has many good qualities . 
As a bond salesman , he started out brilliantly .

It should be rewarded . 
I knew you didn 't love me when I married you . 
I suppose it 's easier to explain to a grown- up , isn 't it ? 
Dad thought maybe I 'd better come back here to you . 
Fanny , you could never look anything but adorable . 
I know perfectly well how I look .

Now , come on , don 't excite yourself . 
I 'm so glad you came . 
Would you like your friends downstairs to know ? 
- Yes . 
- What this party needs is a little gland treatment . 
I won 't be seeing any men in Rio . 
You 're afraid you 'll fall in love with me . 
Yes . 
I 'd love to go . 
A great deal . 
She must be allowed to move about freely .

He wants to help , and so do I. 
It won 't make any difference to me .

And he could have changed for the better too . 
You 're smart .

I never handle anything as won 'thless as a Jardine . 
- Darling , who was it ? 
And me with a poker in my hand ?

It would be best for Nelly to be with me . 
You were to win her tonight . 
- You talk like a novel . 
Did she kiss my husband ? 
" Look thou but sweet , and I am proof against their enmity . 
We should be able to meet on good terms . 
- With pleasure . 
Please , help me !

- O God of all goodness . 
I get pretty unpopular . 
Thanks . 
Mary wouldn 't fall in love with that kind of a man . 
Yes , your little man . 
Darling ... 
She won 't get by me . 
It 's true and you know it . 
I 'll tell you in my own good time . 
Yes , if he goes to the church and climbs up that ladder :

Sit down then , I 'll get your usual , you just relax . 
I bawled her out good , too . 
I mean , I don 't care . 
The dog had a splendid coat everybody admired . 
I hope I don 't hear a dog barking tonight . 
We better go back to town , the bus leaves at five , you know . 
Time is precious now . 
I just want to be at peace . 
- I 'm sure he won 't . 
To save his money and life , he offered him his wife . 
Yes . 
Imagine what a nobody like him ... ... is capable of doing . 
I don 't offer you riches 
Gracious lovely woman 
And has judged it more honorable ... ... to retreat . 
Well , 'tain 't easy , ma , to change the habits of a lifetime . 
There was excitement and adventure . 
Ha , ha , ha . 
The only way you can save him is to get to Ace Larson . 
Very noble of you . 
Chester has been a devoted husband and a fine father .

If you will do me the honor to come with me , please . 
( Man ) That sounds pretty logical to me . 
Well , you see , the patron and I don 't get along very well . 
I hope you 'll overlook this . 
It 's funny the way she ate . 
True . 
Dr. Turner , thank heaven you 've come . 
- Good morning . 
Yes . 
Soon you won 't be able to remember anything . 
These storms don 't do him any good .

But surely you 're going to see that they call her witnesses . 
You don 't love her . 
" must be arriving to those deserving of better happiness ... 
' for it is time that does all true things ... 
- Yes ! 
Up , up , there 's a good dog . 
- I hope so . 
This is a funny house , isn 't it ? 
- I want you to help me . 
I won 't have it . 
Does that satisfy you ? 
I 'm not trying to hurt you I want to free you ... 
I must have it as you had it for my peace of mind . 
- Because I love you . 
Just a nice smooth drink . 
Thank you , thank you , you drunken tramp , you . 
- Better luck next time . 
We 'd better look for something else . 
- Leopards never kill with claws alone . 
This is too fantastic . 
Our crusade will be fulfilled .

Well , guess I 'll have to hunt up my old friend , Kitty Collins . 
Alias Pete Lunn , but best known as the Swede . 
I 'm an honest citizen . 
Good night , Lucy . 
Ease up there ! 
Would that have been more fun , Lucy ? 
It 's all right for you , you 're rich . 
Yes . 
I don 't care about the money , George . 
Hurray ! 
- Save it . 
All right , hero . 
- You free ? 
I think he 's a nice guy . 
And you better hope you never tell it to the cops , either . 
The boys did their best . 
- I don 't remember so good . 
You can 't hand me that stuff . 
Surely not for blackmailing the guests . 
All you had to do was grab it out of her hand .

Take it easy , Mrs. Bennett . 
Yeah , one who overlooked five grand in cash and a mink coat . 
Good ? 
That won 't be necessary . 
They were two of a kind ... 
Don 't let your imagination get the better of you .

I wouldn 't have the courage . 
You should thank God .

Nobody found me funny anymore . 
This is something special we 've got here . 
The only clean thing here is the floor . 
I know he 's alive ! 
I 've got to rescue Dink . 
What a sweet- Iooking face . 
Dogs don 't seem to care for me .

Doing very well , aren 't we , darling ?

It 's like putting your hand in a cash register .

Mr. Justice Putnam , do you mind ? 
- I 'd love to hear it , my dear . 
- Not grim , darling , it 's beautiful . 
You see , Middleburg isn 't all happy memories for me .

Easy does it . 
Maggi , dearest . 
I won 't take care of his damned kid .

I hope you know what I mean . 
I never learnt how to play it ! 
It 's only a mere detail , but of psychological interest . 
It was quite stimulating to speak kindly to the young couple . 
Congratulations on the acquittal , I believe is in order . 
I don 't find this place beautiful anymore . 
If he dies , he won 't be able to paint me ! 
Love and gratitude don 't go together . 
Welcome . 
I must say good bye to someone first . 
Would you lend your lovely body to the artist ? 
But I want to make my masterpiece with you .

I haven 't seen my friend in 3 years . 
They 're having fun . 
A good woman and foot- and- mouth . 
So much the better . 
I always have something on for the hand . 
We want to be ready first . 
Play something cheerful . 
It 's the best cure for a cold .

It 's just pride , your idea of honor .

Sometimes she likes to be surprised . 
Looks like in Pharaoh City they come pretty high . 
Wouldn 't be my luck , would it ? 
Much blood has already been spilled on this beautiful ground . 
I 'll know better after tomorrow . 
Thanks . 
Now , I say that 's nothing but treason . 
I put you in chains , yes . 
You 'd have done better to have remained in bed . 
- Did you have fun ? 
Good night . 
You get dressed and make yourself beautiful . 
Yes . 
- Oh , yes , last Thursday . 
You 're not a bitch . 
That 's the best news I 've ever heard !

People don 't talk to me like that ! 
You see , he was in love with her . 
Yes , Joe did it . 
Got a better one ?

He went up to Geiger 's because he was sweet on Carmen . 
Maybe someday I can do you a real favor . 
I won 't believe it . 
Thanks . 
We were just good friends .

You mean he pines for his dear lost friend Rusty Regan ? 
Well , you shouldn 't join if you can 't take a joke . 
After all ... ... he was in love with her . 
You 're a very funny fella . 
So , with Agnes 's help , I borrowed his stock . 
The General should offer a reward for Regan . 
- We are still friends , aren 't we , soldier ? 
Agnes was wiping herself off the slate for good . 
A harmless little man trying to help someone . 
I haven 't been getting my fair share . 
Sweet little thing , isn 't she ?

You see , he was in love with her . 
Yes , Joe did it . 
Got a better one ? 
Is he any good ? 
He went up to Geiger 's because he was sweet on Carmen . 
Maybe someday I can do you a favor . 
Thanks . 
I wasn 't in love with Shawn .

Good night , Flo . 
Ha ha ha ! 
Well , would you be glad if he did ? . 
Lucky fellow . 
Yes , I did . 
Oh , yes , the strip in the " Mirror " . 
Stand your men at ease , please . 
Well , well , they 've requisitioned the church hall . 
You 're getting pretty hot at this business , David . 
This is good- bye . 
Falling in love with a photograph . 
It wasn 't true ? . 
We 've got that matter in hand . 
Your husband was never in that prison camp . 
You were still in love with him ? . 
I 'll show you such spoilage that you won 't be able to breathe ! 
- I won 't touch you . 
Those peasants don 't take a good enough care of their masters . 
I won 't . 
That vase won 't give me any peace . 
- Good boy , Danila ! 
My dear keen- eyed master . 
You won 't let me leave the mountain ? 
Only Katya is dearer to my heart . 
Well , there you are , darling . 
Ellen doesn 't wish to speak to you . 
Goodbye , and a merry christmas . 
She seemed happy last night . 
You 'd better be because he isn 't . 
I hope it isn 't a concussion . 
You 'd better get out of my way , rump ! 
I 'm glad you picked me up . 
But perhaps it isn 't too late , if our wish is granted . 
I won 't . 
It 's best I speak plainly . 
Yes . 
Is it true , Mr. Frye , 
If you 're not a fool , prove it ! 
Good morning . 
Spent a pleasant evening with this man , 
Yes . 
Oh , yes , a friend of his . 
It was a miscarriage of justice ! 
I was entirely innocent ! 
It won 't be long now , Johnny . 
It won 't go any further . 
All my hopes for him , all my dreams ... 
But I won 't let you do it . 
But , janet , darling , there 's nothing new . 
Darling ... 
I don 't care what you do with me . 
Yes , and they got the fellow what done it . 
My intentions were perfectly honorable . 
You better drink what you have in your hand . 
I 'm not a murderer ! 
She was a very beautiful woman . 
True , you cannot see her nor hear her , 
It 's true , and I 'd be glad to lead you to the victim . 
Yes , some people have to go to prison to be free , you know it ? 
- Yes , Ms. Madden . 
Very funny , Ms. Klotch . 
- Oh , it 's lovely . 
He was a nice fellow , my wife 's a hospitable woman . 
Things like kisses shouldn 't be discussed . 
She was wonderful . 
Okay , Ms. Klotch , come clean . 
Beautiful morning , ain 't it ? 
Can 't you encourage him to get out a little more ? 
It 'll make a lovely scarf . 
- Yes , Ms. Madden .

Everything to gain . 
I wish I knew where Mile de Vermond lived . 
Success must be carried alone . 
- Good . 
Now I 've got to make it good and that 's well nigh impossible . 
Then I come along and cheer him up , don 't I ? 
You found Napoleon 's troops easier to silence than our guests . 
- Why are you smiling ? 
- Yes , you were . 
Wouldn 't it be exciting to find out ? 
- Please , Paul , if you love me ... 
- Yes . 
Nicolo 's arm will be well again soon , won 't it , Nicolo ? 
Surely he could be persuaded ? 
- You 'll not fail , my son . 
One day of Glory equals 100 years of life 
That way , beauties and pleasures disappear , without noise 
What were you thinking going out with a guy like that ! 
I told you that he 's not the kind of guy who thinks it 's fun ! 
- Yeah , yeah ! 
It 's great ! 
We need to do things with a bit of cleverness 
You 're wonderful Charlotte ! 
It 's best that you leave That 's right ! 
Or maybe better , yes I do blame you ! 
I know I 'm a wimp but it 's because I love you . 
Yes , that 's right ! 
It 's good 
- Lovely - Don 't tease me , please 
So I ask for my boots Yes the boots of my second cousin Leon 
And " mirliflore " for young man being " pleasant " 
It 's a friend who travelled a lot who sometimes lends it to me 
Oh , but if it doesn 't please you hey , you 're free 
A slap for a laugh on the street we need the one who receives it 
I 'm innocent ! 
Think yourself lucky that you can chew whatever you like . 
Relax , darling , don 't cry . 
Was he a friend of yours ? 
Sudden hand- to- hand combat . 
Yes , and the bedsheets . 
We show him this , he 'll rat out Tommy Terrific in a heartbeat . 
You 're subverting good evidence . 
I need your help , and you 're on the sidelines . 
I 'm sure you won 't mind if I make myself scarce for a bit . 
- Discretion is the better part of valour . 
- Wave those hand for the muse . 
- Nothing , I hope . 
Some unresolved desire . 
Clear the area ! 
I won 't have it ! 
I 'll take good care of him . 
My friend , okay , i mean , look , I get it . 
I 'm sorry , but that 's the truth , shane . 
- Yes . 
Great news .

You 're much smarter than me , that 's why I ask . 
Just enough to make you wanna treat her like a sister . 
You 'd be amazed . 
- Yes , yes . 
Yes . 
You look happy , character . 
I thought I could help him , that 's why . 
Evidently , the water tasted good so she jumped down the well .

She can take care of herself . 
Somebody 's got to help him . 
But you can save your sympathy . 
Just read the facts , my friend . 
I guess he just isn 't very bright . 
- Would you care to make a reservation ? 
OK , let 's go . 
Thanks very much , Dad . 
All that writing is good- luck messages from his relatives . 
Oh , yes . 
- Why don 't you sit down and relax ? 
Go on and play with your friends .

It 's the best sense I ever heard . 
What a night for love ! 
- Why the grin ? 
Yes , I think I do . 
- Yes . 
Yes , you 're right there . 
He might be too old to think love important . 
I mean , was he a great philosopher or statesman ? 
- Can I help you , sir ? 
May I kiss her ? 
Your smile is not unattractive , sir . 
Your Honour , I apologise for the expression . 
Yes . 
If you love him , step onto this staircase and come with us .

I came to announce the good news . 
So hello the beautiful life ! 
She 'll make a lovely cadaver . 
We 've been happy together . 
Yes . 
Has he come back safe and sound ? 
All the same there were some beautiful girls around . 
Yes , of course I am ! 
At peace . 
Yes . 
Life will be beautiful . 
Yes . 
She 's not going to die , is she ? 
He seems to love her so much . 
Help me get her upstairs . 
Please forgive me . 
We 'd better get him to a hospital . 
Yes . 
If you 'd tell me what it is , perhaps I can help . 
- Please forgive me . 
Help ! 
- Yes . 
Even so , we aim to say , We 'd love to honor and obey , Bee ! 
Honestly , I don 't ! 
Pretty good ? 
If you 're going to shoe that horse , you 'd better get started . 
Yes . 
Honestly , I don 't ! 
Pretty good ? 
If you 're going to shoe that horse , you 'd better get started .

But he 's kind and generous . 
You see , I love you . 
Sorry , darling . 
I 've never seen you so beautiful . 
- Do you think it 's true ? 
It 's not prison or the hangman 's rope . 
It was lucky I was holding Baby in my arms . 
- Yes . 
If I 'm taking care of them , it 's because , well ... 
- I 'm delighted to see you , Larry . 
Gray is such a good fellow . 
I 'm too fond of him for that . 
It was good . 
Well , just the same , I do wish you 'd be nice to her , Isabel . 
My doctors won 't let me touch alcohol . 
You ought to take care of yourself . 
It 's a particularly brilliant season . 
Fireworks , my dear fellow ! 
I wish I 'd never left America ! 
Oh , I hope not . 
There 'll be a thousand people at that party . 
He 's always been very nice to me . 
I hope you don 't mind . 
I don 't think anyone ever loved anyone as I love him . 
You 're a great friend of Mr. Templeton 's , aren 't you ? 
But he 's kind and generous .

Oh , I hope not , but it 's as well to be on the safe side . 
There 'll be 1000 people at her party . 
I don 't think anyone ever loved anyone as I love him .

Be brave , my friend . 
Lucky for him he got away when he did . 
I- I too have no love for them . 
Ah , that 's better . 
You wouldn 't want an innocent man 's blood on your hands . 
Risking everything for a woman 's love . 
Yes .

Risking everything for a woman 's love . 
Yes . 
It isn 't good enough . 
A toy isn 't good enough for him . 
Idealism is a luxury for the very young . 
Wonderful playing , isn 't it ? 
The infallible sign of talent . 
Hobbies , pleasures or fun ? 
You know , I thought I was better in the second half . 
You won 't hear from Brahms . 
Good for art . 
- My family 's having a party . 
It 's nice of the Wrights to show such an interest in you . 
They demand respectability . 
The peculiar thing is that he loves his wife very much . 
You know yourself better than anyone else , Helen . 
Oh , yes , you are .

- Won 't you listen to Lieutenant Delbar ? 
Yes , very well . 
- Good day , gentlemen . 
But what you need is a good bodyguard . 
- I 'll give you a free ride on my camel . 
We gotta save something for a rainy day . 
lf you want to get out of here , help me .

So what do you think good ? 
You look happy to wait for the result . 
It should have a happy side . 
But frank talk are the most beautiful words . 
You are so great . 
He 's something good . 
We won 't do that . 
Thanks . 
- Yes , Mr. Itokawa . 
At least I wish to know . 
And trusted by the financial sector . 
Since he likes to climb hills . 
I wish to have a job like this . 
The present living makes me feel worthy . 
Don 't forget the responsibility for freedom . 
What I feel is happy . 
So what do you think good ? 
You look happy to wait for the result .

Honestly what 's happening ? 
Or at least I would wish to know . 
Since he likes to climb hills . 
I wish to have a job like this . 
The present life makes me feel worthy . 
Don 't forget the responsibility for freedom . 
That 's our reward from our country .

I have a good mind to chuck off the whole case . 
You most certainly did , I heard you . 
Here you 'd better take this .

Leakin , I probably won 't be back this evening . 
Yes , that 's very comforting . 
- Yes , I know . 
I wouldn 't like them to have the advantage on me . 
- Yes , perhaps . 
We 'll get you free . 
Men who 've been good too long , long to wallow in the mud . 
I wish I were married to Keane . 
- What 's the good of telling me that ? 
He 's very fond of me , and I 'd like to keep him so . 
He used strong language . 
Yes , sir , I beg your pardon . 
- Yes . 
But darling , you 've got to remember it 's Tony 's job . 
- Are you in love with him ? 
Someone else said something ... very like that to me recently . 
Yes , sir . 
Hold the Testament in your right hand and repeat the oath .

Thelma can take care of herself . 
- We hope . 
Oh , yes , there it goes . 
- I think we 'd better go . 
- Yes . 
Yes , after 30 years . 
Life can so easily degenerate into something sordid and vulgar . 
What you need is a good night 's rest . 
Good thing we haven 't any servants . 
That 's the last thing I wish to do . 
That 's what mars our happiness . 
I 'm not so dumb . 
If it 's a success , we 'll own the ocean , that 's all . 
- Wouldn 't interest me . 
No , love is something very real and deep . 
Congratulations , Monsieur . 
Very good , just like wine and very dry too . 
- Help ! 
How thrilling . 
- Good . 
That 's true . 
Ten minutes rest will do you good . 
We can never have too much good . 
Numbers sanctify , my good fellow . 
Born as it was from heaven from God 's fallen angel ? 
Thelma can take care of herself . 
- We hope . 
Oh , yes , there it goes .

That 's true . 
If there 's anything I can do , I 'd be happy to . 
Your lack of optimism is fascinating . 
Is that true , Berit ? 
It 'd be better if you paid for a taxi home . 
You 've been so kind . 
There 's nothing but selfishness . 
We take what help we can get . 
That 's true . 
So , would you like some coffee ? 
That’ s nice . 
Is it true , Berit ? 
But she is sweet . 
Do as you wish . 
It wasn’ t always nice at home . 
Be happy that you are being looked after . 
It is better this way . 
But you don’ t care , of course . 
I’ m happy that you’ re here . 
Yes , for me . 
Can you tell me anything about the way she lived , her friends ? 
Everybody liked Jean .

Be glad you 're not a horseback cop . 
Oh , but this is wonderful . 
Oh , isn 't it precious ? . 
This is fantastic !

Can 't you bear to see me happy ? 
Henry , please , I love you . 
She got well pretty quickly . 
- Yes , several . 
I came to know her better , of course , after a while . 
It 's quite precious , you know .

I don 't think it 's a good idea that your son ... 
Well , I hoped it didn 't show . 
She may have known a couple of minor party members . 
- ( Frost ) An important party member ? 
Yes , that would simplify it . 
But I loved him ... insanely . 
- I could enlist the help of the general . 
- Having your hand kissed by Hitler . 
Well , you are beautiful and you 're fun and you 're good to me . 
Take care of our friend . 
More like it , sir .

- That 's cute . 
We Germans can 't afford to be generous .

You didn 't wish anything of the kind . 
Yes , Henry , he 's gone .

I never murdered anyone . 
Oh , yes , yes . 
She doesn 't trust my cooking , Phile . 
Yes .

You wish the outside world to know of our pearls ?

I 'll show my friends the way .

Maybe you 'd better come along too , Owen . 
I 'm not sick . 
I think you better come with me , Caroline .

Yes , you are ! 
Good , I 'll stay here . 
I 'm feeling like a woman . 
Well , promise them something else . 
I 'm grateful for it . 
I 've got two wonderful ones at home . 
A cot 's good enough for most of them . 
Yes , plug it in please . 
It 's nothing but fear . 
Am I glad to see you , I was afraid you were going to be late .

Maybe Stretch give the old man a good talkin ' to . 
If I didn 't know better , I 'd say it was gonna rain . 
Looks like he 's not the only jackass on this trip . 
[ Laughs ] 
Of course , I had good reasons for wantin ' it myself . 
She came down here swingin ' herself pretty fancy . 
They 're friends of yours , ain 't they ?

Now listen , one more crack like that - 
That book fascinates you , doesn 't it , Walker ? 
She meant nothing to me when she was alive ! 
I said I don 't like it ! 
Well , if they were all my old man , it would be a pleasure ! 
You should remind her of her beauty every day of her Iife . 
This aIliance may mean peace for England and Spain . 
Thank heaven I arrived in time to save you . 
MercifuI heavens . 
Perhaps you can enlighten us ? 
So this is the great Don Juan . 
I find persuasion far more effective .

The night is filled with romance 
You gentlemen had better go and see for yourselves . 
Sure is remarkable how dying can make a saint of a man . 
I 'm not angry . 
I thought maybe you might help me . 
You couldn 't help but be a good boy .

- Glad to see you back , Colonel Martin . 
He seemed rather impressed . 
These will go to Washington by special plane . 
I 'd be grateful if you did . 
Probably a good husband too . 
You might try to be more helpful . 
- Yes , Homer ? 
You 're welcome to it . 
You won 't have to do that . 
You can be glad you didn 't have to run a group .

Come with me , love . 
Yes , and the guests ? 
Let 's have some fun for once in our lives . 
Nice couple . 
Don 't drink so much , or you won 't be able to get it up . 
- Edgar , I 'll help you . 
This isn 't just a flirtation or a whim . 
I won 't give up until she 's walking down that aisle . 
She 's a gorgeous girl . 
Well , it sure shot mine full of holes . 
Good night . 
- Yes , I most certainly do . 
You were wonderful . 
- You do care . 
You 're making a great mistake . 
Yes . 
- I won 't allow it . 
I don 't think you saw a good show that night . 
But His Excellency would never hang a man without evidence . 
And I don 't care to undervalue myself . 
Excellency , I await your permission . 
What is your wish , Manuela ? 
You were wonderful .

He 's the great business head . 
Oh , now , surely you must have some friends onboard . 
But we love 'em We want more of 'em 
But we love 'em We want more of 'em 
The slogan of my firm is " Never kiss a client 's wife . " 
Oscar , I 'm in love . 
You don 't know what it 's like to want someone . 
ln high school , I was voted the boy most likely to succeed . 
To think that we gave up a perfectly good rib . 
Take it from me , that girl has all sorts of talent .

Lucky for your friends at home . 
She meant no more to me than a beautiful painting . 
She had a world of courage , but no great strength . 
That makes it less perfect . 
God bless your eyes . 
He didn 't understand I no longer loved him . 
Hope . 
Help me , Ravic . 
Yes . 
Are we automatons that we can turn love on and off ? 
I wish I could come with you . 
Yes . 
You won 't . 
Which side , Champs- Elysées or Georges V ? 
Don 't we even dare say good- bye decently ? 
I 'd help you if I could . 
Our last hope is gone . 
It 's the hope of living happily here that stopped me . 
Take care . 
I was ready to support her . 
I won 't leave . 
It 's free . 
My dear ! 
I 'd help if I could . 
Our last hope is gone . 
It 's true . 
Only the hope of being happy when I got back here kept me going . 
I 'll find freedom and happiness my own way . 
- You 'll treat me ? 
Yes , she has syphilis . 
Not good at all . 
Take care . 
I was ready to support her . 
- So you 're happy when it 's over ? 
I 'd help you if I could .

So you 'll be happy , no ? ! 
But this time I saved my hair . 
Good morning , Mrs. Tosca . 
I love you so ! 
- Yes ! 
- I 'm not dumb at all . 
You are a good boy , I can read it on your face . 
But I don 't like certain things . 
I don 't care anymore . 
- Good morning . 
His Honour 's had the floor . 
I 'm gonna declare a holiday . 
- You haven 't heard the funny part . 
You can help out too . 
Well , Stacey , it looks like we got three fresh horses . 
The guests are on theirway to the party .

If you want something better , go to school , learn a trade . 
This is quite an improvement .

In fact , it 's a lot better . 
You bet I want you to be like them . 
I never got anything yet worthwhile without trouble .

Your affectionate father , Rauf of Bulaire . "

But this ... is not so stupid . 
It won 't win against an attack , of course . 
Good . 
- But if great lady wishes - 
It 's not the way the miracle said . 
Play the real game with me , scholar , and the best game . 
Tell my grandson that - Oh , what 's the good ? 
Perhaps the good bishop could tell my lord - 
What good is it ?

You 'd better tell yourself a bedtime story . 
Think you 're pretty smart . 
- Good night , doctor . 
Someone he 'd lived with and loved so long . 
Just give it a happy ending , you know how .

He 's feeling better and the clock is ticking again . 
They made the bomb . 
I went to the Peace Park . 
Yes , I like her . 
Yeah , I like you . 
If you 'd like to make a call , please hang up and try again . 
Fours years ago , we won the Pantheon Cup ! 
Make a ritual out of it , people will respect you . 
Be proud , son . 
Can I be honest with you ? 
- Yes , I am . 
That 's a winning attitude , J. 
Because he sure can 't run like I can . 
Brilliant . 
The crazier they are , the more the crowd likes it . 
Nice spot . 
Winning is the only thing I respect . 
You feel like if I play my way , I just might win . 
What you care about ? 
Bodies that are year- round great , but crack just like china . 
You 're gonna play innocent ? 
We did win the Pantheon though , didn 't we ? 
Throwing him against the best pass rush in the league ? 
I chased off anyone who 's ever loved me . 
San Francisco sure took care of that for us . 
OK , let’ s go . 
I won 't tell the Japanese , I swear it . 
My husband tells me you’ ve been very helpful to the Colonel . 
If so , they’ re doing a good job ! 
I hope . 
Just how much did you bet on yourself today , smart boy ? 
You had better tell me . 
- I thought you said George Gardner was a good jock . 
I 'll win by a mile , if I can . 
We better go, Joe . 
Good night . 
Seems every hope we 've cherished for a year has been a mirage . 
Take back the freedom thou cravest

Yes , sir . 
Yes , and as for money ... 
What a way to welcome a friend . 
Nor on light , divine gift 
You are better than any other 
And love someone 
But that 's not the worst part . 
Yes , there can . 
So , it was excellent for diabetics . 
- Do you need any help , Francisca ? 
See how I could be useful at your side ? 
We could still be very happy . 
Good job our tyres are good . 
No milk and very strong , please . 
It would have been better if he had . 
" honour above all " . 
Relax ! 
We can relax for eight days .

But , after all , she won 't know , will she ? 
A few minor corrections , and not bad at all . 
Delightful evening , Narbonne . 
Clear your vents ! 
Apparently , I have been saved from making a greater one . 
It 's as peaceful as a clambake .

You think my hand 's a blooming sea biscuit ?

See he has a good night 's rest . 
Oh , yes . 
Does that sound like a dream ? 
Inside , champ . 
That might be just as good as talking to Solly . 
A guy who loves you like that , that ain 't love . 
- That 's interesting . 
The Good Book says silence is golden . 
And it 's a cheap way to ask for your respect . 
Me , Ben Arno , begging like some kid , like a cur dog . 
- Tell me you love me . 
And I took good care of the kid , didn 't I ? 
- You 'll be doing a good deed . 
Welcome , chemist . 
I never imagined you 'd play with a girl 's heart to win a bet . 
While I was away , Alec was a great replacement . 
- I feel like kissing you ! 
I loved you on a rainy afternoon . 
This is a day of joy . 
As much as I love you , I 'm obliged to stay with him forever .

Yeah , it doesn 't surprise me . 
That 's what I was hoping for . 
Yes , I do . 
But I knew a big shot over there who 'd always liked me . 
Well , it seems like Zanuck has got himself a baseball picture . 
Well , I sure turned in to an interesting driveway . 
You 're not really a smuggler , are you ? 
We must be strong . 
You won 't . 
Life can be beautiful . 
You 've been good to me .

He saved my life , did you know that ? 
I don 't want anybody to see them looking like that . 
Got any friends ? 
You are welcome . 
Bowdre here 's gonna wish he did , too . 
Yes , sir , Warden .

You don 't care about me or anybody . 
A little hard , but interesting .

It 's funny how much better the stars look from down here . 
Yes . 
Let 's have something nice and cool like chili peppers . 
Maybe you 'd better lie down . 
Well , I don 't like it . 
This is the way to treat Bette Davis ? 
So relax there 's only one word for yes 
That 's so easy to find 
Seymour won 't go to Hollywood and I can 't leave him here . 
Well , I 'd better go . 
- Yes , look . 
Remember , it 's better to give than receive . 
- You better have a look at her , Doc . 
Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the Lucky Dollar . 
Don 't even think like that , my friend . 
We run a clean town . 
Alive , she 's won 'th $50, 000 . 
I 'm just taking pot- luck ! 
I meant keep smiling . 
You 're a splendid fella . 
And they won 't , you know . 
Run away and make yourself useful . 
One moment , my friend . 
You look healthy enough to me . 
I 'm not going to die !

Good thing , really .

You come to your friends . 
The Twist is much better . 
Very good . 
- Yeah , it 's been a lot of fun . 
- Take it easy . 
Give me a hand . 
Who cares ? 
Every link in our security chain was and is solid . 
- Then maybe you 'd better go back to the violin . 
We 'll take care of everything . 
- Mercy Maud ! 
A person with inner dignity is never embarrassed . 
- At your age , you won 't even feel it . 
- Yes . 
My heart 's as good as his any day . 
- Honestly , Dad , how do you expect us to ever be popular ? 
- You 'll back me up , won 't you ? 
Why , I 'd feel positively naked . 
Yes , son .

Things won 't be like they were in Georgia . 
- Thanks to me . 
You dang blasted showoff , you cost me my best six- shooter . 
You better learn to tell the difference . 
- Come on , we 'd better get out of here . 
We are good doctors here . 
Yes , I know that . 
But you were smart .

Interesting thing is how I talked my way out . 
Yes , I know that . 
But you were smart . 
Will this take care of it ? 
Then i shall take care not to arouse it . 
There are more pleasant companions . 
Yes . 
But not every gentleman would have been so considerate . 
Are its charms so ordinary that they may be easily cast aside ? 
I got a personal interest in you , palinov . 
You know it 's you I love ! 
Let 's have a good time ! 
Easy , Sergeant ! 
He 's going to win for sure ! 
You 're all trying to help him ! 
I 've come to help you ! 
Never trust strangers with a little creature ! 
But they don 't realize that I 'm still the strongest ! 
Dear , do you like your brother . 
Intelligent asshole , do not argue with him . 
I 'm not against work , to take care of you . 
We are just friends . 
You 're lucky . 
You 're always there to rescue me . 
Is this true ? 
Funny , funny . 
Where is justice ? 
Uncle , you look like a rich man . 
We will be freed of them forever . 
This is heroism ? 
Do you love him ? 
You should learn to respect other men 's girls . 
The officer said he won 't take any responsibility for this . 
Smart cop . 
Yes , I know . 
Funny how things come clearer when it 's too late . 
Give me your hand , Sheila .

On top of everything else , it was a friend 's bag . 
How much money do you need to put on that party . 
Be satisfied with running off with the expenses . 
Cute isn 't he ? 
Thanks anyway , though . 
Thanks a lot . 
I 'm not going to kill myself . 
He’ s still in love with you . 
- Have some compassion . 
She’ s a romantic twit . 
But if you 're not the groom ... you’ re not so bad . 
- You should have fun . 
You look great . 
Holden’ s father and my father made friends . 
He has no family ... but we can be his friends . 
You know my sentiments , but very happy birthday . 
I used to lie in my cell and dream of someone like you . 
I’ m through with love . 
That was great . 
I remember us making love . 
Maybe we could send someone to save you . 
We 'd be better off as single- cell organisms . 
From the canal ! ~ Who 's going to clean him up ? ~ Me . 
~ It feels like a miracle . ~ OK . 
- Need help ? 
Let 's hope to find room at " Vecchia Pineta " .

It 's my favorite tango .

- Marcella , come , be good ! 
It won 't be Marcella .

Better let me go in , Hank . 
I really thought he loved me . 
- And I wanna help you . 
- You better shut up . 
For myself , I don 't care . 
My intentions in coming here are perfectly honourable ! 
Yes . 
If you could do that , it 'd be really helpful . 
I think happiness is living the way you want to live . 
Don 't feel so good ? 
Here , make yourself comfortable . 
I won 't let anyone point their finger at you . 
Among all those men , there must have been a few that you liked . 
I m talking for your benefit here . 
Yes . 
You sure took good care of her . 
It 's best to forget about things that are over and done with . 
Won 't our spheres of interest overlap ? 
- It closes like a safe . 
That 's the funny thing about a monster company . 
We have to save the essential assets . 
We have excellent connections .

There goes one of our best brains . 
I have to know if my husband is still alive !

You finally convinced me . 
Glad you didn 't leave town tonight ? 
I don 't care what you do , go take all the blondes you want . 
It isn 't true . 
- How are you , noble prince ? 
- Yes . 
Yes , sir . 
I was smart . 
- Very funny . 
Good thing you like my face . 
A few points that aren 't quite clear . 
A girl like you should think about security . 
I 'm not lying , I just didn 't tell you . 
- Take it easy , son . 
If I were Capt. Lochner , I could get a good case against you . 
This isn 't going to be as easy to get out of .

Couldn 't find a hangnail if they told you what hand it was on . 
Oh , but it 's good to be alive , Jo ! 
You really didn 't say nothing that wasn 't true . 
- Yes . 
He was a great artist . 
Yes , you .

Then you 'd better learn or I 'll have to teach you .

Thanks to your trainee and you , the police are involved . 
Please , gentlemen , be very careful with that statue . 
The rescue squad brought you in . 
I can help . 
I 'm going to help get you out of it . 
- Nice meeting you , Mr. Percy . 
What is a one and only love ? 
Other women find love and happiness . 
With hunchbacks and midgets , I always rub the back for luck . 
You said I made you happy . 
Honest , you haven 't , now or ever . 
I want to be good to you . 
Honest , I will . 
But it is free . 
How could you expect such a woman to care for anyone ? 
- I wish I could . 
With great success , it became respectable . 
Great , there goes a month 's profit . 
She could take some fucking great photographs in here . 
My father called it a gift . 
Mr. Powerful and his entourage are here . 
You didn 't hear your road dog calling for help on your machine . 
- Good to see you , David .

And all I can say is , thank God for my precious daughter . 
She was ... ... friendly . 
They 're like best friends . 
And I wish I could help her . 
And I loved her .

You did not tell me she was so beautiful , monsieur . 
If the court pleases , this man will not answer me . 
I don 't want your loyalty , Genflou . 
Although , I can wish that all this had never occurred . 
Yes , I heard . 
You 've won . 
I love Cosette , it 's true ... but not as you seem to think .

There are men of the law with determination ! 
Perhaps it would be wise for you to turn back . 
Well , good . 
He 's quite safe ... at the moment . 
Yes , I suppose so . 
Beyond that charming room is only a passage out of the castle . 
Yes , I 'm afraid there is . 
You 've been very kind . 
Like you love the Englishman . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
But fortunately , there 's such a thing as justice . 
They are not dead .

Yes , I know . 
He won 't like it when he finds you 've locked me in this house .

Gwendolyn talks so ... so nice . 
You like the people who are good to you .

You 're not that much of a prize . 
- Would the other heirs care to reconsider ? 
She hollered for me to help her . 
Yes , sir . 
A free press , sir , like a free life , is always in danger .

It 's really helpful . 
Hey , I think I 've seen your friend somewhere before . 
Yeah , yeah ... 
What are they laughing at ? 
She did nothing but cry ... ... and talk about you . 
You can thank God that she 's not my sister . 
- My friend Marisa . 
Men don 't care if a woman is stupid or intelligent . 
This trip seems to have cheered Elena up , anyway . 
That 's funny . 
Well , you certainly acted like you enjoyed it . 
She won 't even talk to me . 
We gotta take care of him . 
It 's a good thing you came along , Lieutenant . 
And you better be there promptly , too , buddy . 
She kissed me ! 
But General Patton has outrun his line of communication support . 
Yes , sir . 
We 'll take good care of 'em . 
How 'd you get them so interested in the work ? 
What 's your pleasure ? 
This is glory ? 
Good evening . 
I was a friend of Neal 's . 
Yes . 
Oh , he 's not a criminal in the ordinary sense . 
Yes , many times . 
Well , I won 't listen to it . 
Let 's hope this little vacation will cure that . 
Might have known you 'd be in love with her . 
If your government isn 't satisfied , it can go elsewhere . 
I am very easily dominated . 
He has such an honest face . 
Yes , I completely agree , Mr. Congressman . 
So our appreciation may be properly stated . 
You made a lot of progress , Joe . 
When the truth is , you 've already accepted one . 
You know I won 't be influenced by it . 
Convincing ? 
And some of the telegrams he received were favorable . 
Yes , this is district 6530 . 
Hooray for them . 
You got a little mud on your nice white suit , 
And some good ones retired after just one term ,

Caesar commanded us to keep the peace . 
Of course , I shall do my feeble best to amuse you . 
Your Excellency will agree . 
Have you tried me to prove your friendship ? 
We will free him ! 
Claudius wanted me to free him . 
For the first time , I see there is good in the world .

Madame may wait , but His Excellency is out

You look like a pooped- out pinwheel ! 
I will use physical means , Great One . 
I wish to make an estimate of my own ! 
- Yes ! 
People just won 't let them alone , will they ? 
Honestly ! 
It isn 't that I don 't appreciate what she does .

Mr. Grivet , if you weren 't a friend of 30 years — 
You 're strong and beautiful . 
Go tear up Therese 's curtains , if she welcomes you . 
Tell me you still love me a little . 
A sudden passion like that can 't be called love . 
My friend , please don 't get upset . 
It wasn 't on the train , surely . 
But there 's merit in doing them anyway , isn 't there ? 
You 've been so good to me . 
Here is an interesting subject . 
Here 's three lovely ladies right over here . 
A cultural exhibition that 'll enlighten you , amaze you .... 
Yes , wasn 't it ? 
Perhaps you would help me to bring her back . 
I knew her so well . 
Intuition isn 't much help in police work . 
It was very good of you to listen and be so patient . 
You know , this fellow Jarrod 's good . 
- I guess it 's a very good likeness . 
I don 't care for that kind of patronage !

Noble words , Bleda . 
I have faith in human fraternity . 
Unlike you , I do not have a son to take care of . 
Your only ideal is your own ambition . 
Dominicus , I want him to go to heaven . 
I like you better as a woman than as a prophetess . 
What if Ezio wins ? 
Place the best archers in the middle . 
But I have faith . 
But remember , Attila , innocent blood won 't be washed away . 
We 'll send him the antlers as a gift . 
That 's his reward for hunting on our lands . 
- Yes . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
True . 
His sword dropped from his hand . 
Trust me , they will . 
We 'll take care of her when the time is right . 
A short walk with your friend . 
I don 't care . 
Yes , General . 
Yes , General . 
- Why do you help me ? 
Aetius can take care of himself . 
Do you have friends on the outside ? 
Yes , Your Majesty . 
- Great King , I ... 
If you rescue her , she 'll marry you . 
I think I would enjoy that very much . 
Yes , sire . 
- Yes , General . 
( Laughing ) 
Few of us will ever know the blessings of a piecefull old age . 
From now on , I 'll protect your interests !

- Cheer up ! 
I 'm not lying ! 
I won 't allow someone with no experience to go down alone ! 
She was so young , and to leave such a sweet little boy behind . 
- Yes . 
You 're splendid . 
Tonight it will be my pleasure to act as your Mephistopheles . 
But I had a truly marvelous day today . 
And I 'm grateful she had me . 
I think it 's best you give up that proposal . 
I 'm positive . 
Yes , you 're right . 
Sake doesn 't taste good either , right ? 
Take care of him first ! 
Yes ... 
I wish if you would never find the pot . 
Maybe I should give him to somebody who likes kids . 
Yes . 
Mistress , you should be more honest . 
We 're not angry at all . 
He 'll be happy to leave if we give him one or two ryo . 
Don 'tworry , my dadwill help us 
Then he 'll letme take care of everything 
We 're friends 
Butthen I 'm mature 
Yes 
I 'll adore youforever 
Yes I am . 
I won 't have any more . 
You must remember when some man gains your hand in marriage . 
What should I do , kiss 'em ? 
They don 't care about that . 
My darling ... ... as if that could ... 
Better wear shoes today 
Be patient and cheer up 
You don 't care , laughing at others 
That 's why we can 't save any money 
Well , we can 't praise them 
Good morning 
You must be strong 
I want you to be happy and healthy 
The noodles you gave us tasted so good 
Since then , my parents won 't come near me 
I don 't care if I am , who cares ? 
And that 's good 
He won 't ever return 
Please help ! 
- They 'll laugh ! 
Do you trust me or don 't you ? 
You see we want to be peaceful and friendly . 
She wants help to get him out . 
It can be beautiful and everybody has one . 
He 's better than I thought he was , in every way . 
Jaq , maybe you 'd better explain things to him . 
Oh , Lucifer , won 't you ever learn ? 
Well ... now for a good night 's sleep . 
Clean that up , and then help my daughters dress . 
Announcing His Imperial Grace , the Grand Duke . 
Nothing can help now , nothing . 
Clear the square ! 
- Who would support us ? 
Otherwise you won 't be able to resist . 
This time you won 't escape ! 
He 's happy enough to borrow money from us . 
I won 't serve you any more ! 
The councillors won 't dare . 
You 'll save them . 
They won 't move . 
Have mercy ! 
- Lord , bless our daily bread . 
A matter of your honour , Highness . 
Is your soul satisfied now ? 
I hope he 'll come today 
The best bulls of the province . 
Yes , I know one . 
He 's good to you , as good as he can be . 
Mmm with a helping hand 
- What do you wish ? 
- Oh I was looking for you - My dearest Amelia , 
Nothing , I 'm as strong as 40 sacred baboons . 
Watch wisdom and the piety of my love ! 
Would you care ? 
Our friendship has brought me here . 
Horemheb as your friend . 
Your men deserve justice . 
I learned that also in my new wisdom . 
Oh my love ! 
I love you , Sinuhe . 
Better that we had not come ! 
They succeeded in discovering a new metal . 
I doubled my fortune as a physician of the rich . 
Give me your hand . 
The disease is already well advanced . 
Because one day she was very pretty . 
But the rich have diseases most interesting and can afford . 
If you love me , Sinuhe 
' il be much better without these fanatics . 
Merit ! 
Yes , commander ! 
Yes , your majesty . 
But the house of God is all creation . 
Did not give him pain some , your majesty . 
Saved me ? 
Take care , doctor ... or I 'll ... 
I 'm not lying ! 
Yes . 
I 'm not lying ! 
I won 't allow someone with no experience to go down alone ! 
I 'm not lying ! 
Yes . 
I still have my virtue , Julie , honestly . 
About my hand ? 
Yes . 
Your Royal Higness I trust I will be your guide ... 
Yes , I 'm sure I know . 
I still have my virtue , Julie , honestly . 
About my hand ? 
You are glad you came to Paris with us , don 't you ? 
Yes . 
Your Royal Higness I trust I will be your guide ... 
Yes , I 'm sure I know . 
We never had a moment 's peace with you . 
He won 't understand . 
- I have never hated him . 
If you love him so much , why did you marry me ? 
- It wouldn 't do you any good . 
You 're here to see your beloved , right ? 
You won 't tell me what it is ? 
- And you love him ! 
Don 't you realize that Alejandro can only love me ? 
- Yes . 
She loves you more than I do Eduardo . 
By the moonlight and in her dreams , she pronounces your name . 
That can 't be true . 
And if I didn 't care ? 
I won 't rest until I do . 
Because he doesn 't deserve kindness . 
Help me with her . 
You are the best one , after all . 
God save us from him .

Promise you won 't see him again . 
And if I didn 't care ? 
I won 't rest until I do . 
Eduardo , you have always been good to everyone , 
Because he doesn 't deserve kindness . 
Help me with her . 
You are the best one , after all . 
God save us from him . 
Every night I had to lock him in his room to keep him safe . 
They won 't win this war , they can 't master the language . 
You must help me , the world is little , we 'll meet again . 
- I 'll take care ! 
CAMAN , CAMAN , " Help " America ! 
Wow , what a car !

He 's a pilot en route to Kevlock Island for special duty . 
Funny , the way I see it , I saved our hides . 
I 'm close by , sweetie , you just have to find me . 
What kind is she ? 
Better take your snowshoes . 
If it was just you , I 'd wish it was black . 
He was a brave when Fremont camped at Pyramid Lake . 
That was way over 60 years ago , so he must be pretty old . 
Doesn 't anybody think he can take care of himself ? 
You better go in to your mother . 
Think how happy Curt was when he found Arthur out there .

There had never been such riots in front of the bench . 
I trust in your sense of justice . 
Justice is fallible . 
My father has always been very generous . 
Often marrying means signing away your freedom . 
People talked - I couldn 't help it . 
Before him was this morally superior woman . 
I remember , I fell in love with a prostitute . 
Only in silence could I preserve a fragment of human dignity . 
An aristocratic hand ; a little gentleman . 
Ask whatever you wish . 
In the purses of the rich , in the bodies of martyred boys ? 
I liked you a lot , young Mohl . 
Let 's not prolong this meeting ; you know it won 't do any good . 
It doesn 't matter - I don 't accept that !

- Are you sure you 're not hurt ? 
You 're lucky that I have to go , but we 'll play a rematch soon . 
Yes .

You don 't know how to treat kids . 
If only I 'd been born as beautiful as Kikuko ! 
You 're so kind to Kikuko , aren 't you , Father ? 
- " Oh , dear , oh , dear ! " 
You show affection only for Kikuko 
He always asks her friend to sing for him 
Thanks for having us again 
Good morning . 
Don 't just stand around like that ! 
Why is everybody so interested in what happens to Kikuko ? 
You have no love for others ! 
It still looked like spinach ! 
Yes , she wants some crackers . 
I wish I were as pretty as Kikuko . 
You 're very good to her . 
And she was very pretty ! 
You 're not bad . 
They won 't have to move out . 
Good morning . 
And the ones who don 't care about anybody . 
A happy wife would never understand how I feel . 
She didn 't want to wind up like me . 
Yes .

He wanted champagne , but he got absinthe like everyone else . 
Say olé with more passion . 
My friend 's in a hurry . 
- Relax . 
You 're a brave little soldier . 
If our lovely lady has crippled Nini , I 'll break your jaw . 
Matter triumphs over mind . 
You are the love of my life . 
Ah , yes . 
- My dear ! 
I 'm not angry with you . 
Alex , you 're so much better than the rest of us . 
I stuck my nose where I shouldn 't have , but I survived .

No , she 's from one of the best families . 
I 'll do my best , but I can 't promise . 
In a day or two , with a little sun , it 'll be beautiful again . 
Listen , don 't put on your superior airs . 
Good- bye . 
I 've going to help you . 
Tell me what I 'm thinking is true . 
Yes , because I know what it means . 
You just won 't take certain things seriously . 
Why do you treat her that way ? 
- Want me to help you ? 
A woman with more talent than her man is truly unfortunate . 
I 'm very happy to be here . 
Sweetheart , I 'm not going to Clelia 's . 
But you 'll come to dinner , won 't you ? 
Help me out . 
The fact his show wasn 't a success is just a coincidence . 
If he were more confident , he would have cared less . 
We shouldn 't care about anything , right ? 
If you 're so smart , why didn 't you ...

More of a hospital kind .

- You look good . 
Listen , I got a chance at a job , playing with a band . 
I was hoping you 'd come see me . Y 
- Oh , I wouldn 't honest ! 
Ha ! 
Yes , but in a very nice way . 
Maybe this band leader won 't like how you play 
A man has a right to study his hand . 
It 'll be quicker and better than doing it your way . 
He has a wonderful lab here . 
I 'm beginning to see now why you love it here . 
The bones just stripped clean , like peeling a banana . 
No fun , mind you , but harmless .

Youre certainly not getting into the spirit of things , madam .

Yes , well , I better get on with my business . 
He 'll understand , Amelie , he won 't discharge me . 
That is an extremely handsome woman . 
- Yeah , she 's in love with Paul . 
Not for you , darling . 
Good heavens , a customer . 
I got 10 years for a better set of books than these . 
You won 't . 
Nice bookkeeping . 
- I wish I could be like you . 
- I can hardly keep from laughing myself . 
- It 's true . 
- That was very considerate of him . 
I don 't trust him . 
If there were three , madame , you 'd better tell the commandant . 
If we could find Adolphe , he could do us another favor . 
- Good . 
Yes , he loves you . 
- As long as she 's happy . 
Funny how it all happened . 
Yes , well , I better get on with my business .

You are outside the party , and that monument must be ... 
I am tenacious , wary and proud . 
- What can you hope for ? 
I have my orders , I have faith in them . 
You 're not the violent sort . 
How ... ... can you give back ... ... honour ? 
- Yes . 
But free , sane , walking the world ...

I like it ! 
Ain’ t she funny ? 
Always making out they were better than I was . 
I don’ t care . 
I can’ t help it ! 
- I won 't even speak to him ... 
I like it ! 
# I have a funny feelin ' that I won # 
If the eggbeater don 't work , I give you something just as good .

What , darling ? 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Yes . 
Never quite fit the pattern , did I ? 
like thunder on a clear day . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
You better bring in some wood from the shed , Ben . 
You mean all of this is over a hand of poker ? 
You ain 't very bright , are you , kid ? 
That 's better than shooting you down . 
Just one favor , that 's all . 
We 'd get a nice , quiet little place in the country . 
I loved her . 
I was perfectly well on the boat . 
I almost wish we had gone straight to England instead . 
But you see the medicine must be prepared with great care . 
Oh , good heavens . 
Meanwhile , number 254 is a very nice room . 
However , if you wish to go and inquire at other hotels ... 
Why won 't they tell me anything ? 
Good night . 
Danny 's got friends . 
Easy , now . 
What do you expect , three cheers ? 
I 'll take care of Don this time . 
I 'd rather be lucky than good . 
Superior playing . 
Yes . 
I think you know that better than anybody else , Mrs. Sutton . 
Yes . 
You will be relieved to hear there was nothing wrong with it . 
" We wish to thank you for the patience you have shown ... 
We keep this place in good shape . 
Give me a hand here , will you ? 
Honey , take it easy , sweetheart . 
I won 't be needing any milk for a while . 
Look , I 'll bring you a good plane , a small one . 
So I thought I 'd save you that long trip on the subway . 
We 'll be just in time for a good hot dinner at the shelter . 
You know , Mr. Sears , you really do look like Santa Claus now . 
Perhaps his taste in ties has improved . 
You 've been wonderful , Lyle . 
I do wish you 'd give up the idea . 
These objects play an important part in tonight 's tale . 
Yes , sir . 
I 'm afraid that won 't be necessary . 
You know that I 'm good for an alibi if the price is right . 
Well , good evening , gentlemen . 
Yes , Mr. Barney . 
I got me some choice words you 'd appreciate . 
I 'd better get Mike back in here for you . 
Your husband won 't be back till late . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
See if I care ! 
Living in a tenement on a day like this is living boiled alive . 
Not if I can help it . 
Maybe , we better go to her husband . 
Next week at this same time , I hope to see you again . 
But you do want me to look beautiful for you , don 't you ? 
You haven 't had a winner for three weeks . 
Thanks to you and your friend , he hasn 't got a dime . 
Well , happy days . 
Oh , yes . 
I think we are fortunate that we found out in time . 
Doesn 't Hermione arrange things beautifully ? 
This is a time for rejoicing . 
But strong as an ox . 
Give him a good dinner . 
But I won 't . 
Good night , Henri . 
I 'm sure he 'll like you in that dress , too , madame . 
Come now , wine is good for the blood . 
I got a better idea . 
If you had telegraphed , it would have been easier . 
It 's the safest place in the world , Theodore . 
Why , yes . 
Yes , that would follow . 
Dear , this won 't do at all . 
You won 't let me have it , then ? 
You know it 's true . 
That 's an interesting question . 
I would find you delightful , all the rest of our days . 
It 'll be no great loss , I 'm sure . 
Yes , I found the book . 
Great . 
Oh , yes . 
Here 's the safety . 
Yes . 
And that wonderful Mr. Nash . 
You ain 't a nice girl like I thought . 
No one else ever thought I was as beautiful as you do . 
I loved her so much . 
But you 'd appreciate my getting to the point . 
I can help you find him . 
No one else ever thought I was as beautiful as you do . 
Yes , that 's right . 
But I think it 's best if we never see each other again . 
Yes . 
Good night . 
He trusted me and now I 've let him down . 
Yes ? 
Thanks , anyway . 
You 'd better stay here . 
Oh , thank heavens , Lieutenant . 
After a week of this , it 's a wonder we 're not all sick . 
Take our friend here . 
Help me , somebody ! 
To the likes of you , maybe . 
You want me to take it easy ? 
We keep this place in good shape . 
Give me a hand here , will you ?

He trusted me and now I 've let him down . 
Yes ? 
Thanks , anyway . 
You 'd better stay here . 
Oh , thank heavens , Lieutenant . 
After a week of this , it 's a wonder we 're not all sick . 
Take our friend here . 
Help me . 
To the likes of you , maybe . 
You want me to take it easy ? 
You better bring in some wood from the shed , Ben . 
You mean all of this is over a hand of poker ? 
You ain 't very bright , are you , kid ? 
That 's better than shooting you down . 
Just one favor , that 's all . 
We 'd get a nice , quiet little place in the country . 
I loved her . 
I was perfectly well on the boat . 
I almost wish we had gone straight to England instead . 
But you see the medicine must be prepared with great care . 
Oh , good heavens . 
Meanwhile , number 254 is a very nice room . 
However , if you wish to go and inquire at other hotels .... 
Why won 't they tell me anything ? 
Good night . 
Danny 's got friends . 
Isn 't it lovely ? 
What do you expect , three cheers ? 
Thank God . 
I 'll take care of Don this time . 
I 'd rather be lucky than good . 
Superior playing . 
Yes . 
I think you know that better than anybody else , Mrs. Sutton . 
Yes . 
You will be relieved to hear there was nothing wrong with it . 
" We wish to thank you for the patience you have shown ... 
I would , with pleasure . 
She deluded herself into thinking that he was in love with her . 
It wouldn 't help . 
You can trust me . 
Yes . 
Oh , I won 't . 
We 're glad to have you . 
Well , good night . 
I thought I 'd better get out of there . 
In fact , I think it 's rather good . 
If I wasn 't in such a good humor today , 
You won 't be overdue . 
I mean , to think I had so little courage . 
Doctor says it was a miracle . 
I won 't keep you long . 
Well , that was a surprise . 
It sounds like perfect dinner conversation . 
Oh , yes , I didn 't think of that . 
Cissie , you 've got to help me . 
Except for the newspapers who detected a love triangle . 
Okay , pal , you won the deal . 
With the rest of Clinker 's money , I might win back everything . 
Good night . 
That was very thoughtful of you . 
Let 's hope . 
There won 't be a next time . 
Yes . 
She 's beautiful . 
But whenever he was in love , he 'd turn into a poet . 
It 's most impressive . 
Good evening , Mrs. Fenton . 
Oh , Charles , I want to make friends ... 
I will not be kept a prisoner in this house any longer . 
I wish he had just a little more imagination . 
Actually , I 'm very grateful to him . 
That 's funny . 
So you won 't even consider it ? 
Excellent . 
Well , it certainly can 't be anything physical . 
You , you 're doing very nicely . 
But you better go . 
Thank you and good- bye . 
I hope you enjoy your stay with us . 
Yes . 
You 've got to help me get him out of here . 
Oh , he is just one of the most important men in our party . 
That was only good business . 
No , sweetheart , he won 't . 
Yeah , thanks for nothing . 
Will you help me ? 
Oh , such noble sentiments . 
It wasn 't easy , Richard . 
Please , Mrs. Kopeck , I wouldn 't think of obstructing justice . 
I merely stole from the rich to help the poor . 
Your name is clear , your job is clear , you 're $50, 000 ahead . 
I think I 'd better wait in the car . 
Yes , I thought you loved Grace . 
Grace was my secretary . 
And I loved her , even though she had no pity for my love . 
She was searching for someone to love , someone to leave me for . 
" He and his are not neglected by the gods , 
" Which is better God only knows . " 
May God have mercy on your soul . 
Town won 't be the same without you . 
Annette , do you love me ? 
But she seemed so happy with me . 
Now , this guy 's the answer to all your dreams . 
May I help you ? 
You were lucky so far . 
You don 't have any faith . 
I see you keep souvenirs of your success as a detective . 
Oh , would you care for some more brandy ? 
We were hoping you 'd be more cooperative . 
If you feel so strongly about it and Jackie feels the same way ... 
Okay , okay . 
Well , you see to it he makes an honest woman of her . 
Darling . 
She says clearly as anything . 
I won 't be long . 
Sounds as good as the bank . 
I loved you . 
Won 't I ? 
She 's a respectable woman . 
Well , if you hear of a pretty one , let me know . 
" For more than three years I had the best 
" That 's good publicity for an ambitious D. A. 
" It made me feel lucky . 
" But did our great prosecutor know that ? 
I loved her ! 
I just wanted a little fun . 
Stan loves you . 
After all a one minute commercial never hurt anyone . 
The moment I touched her hand ... 
You 'd better give me your coat , darling . 
I can see that clearly . 
We won 't get the money . 
Yes . 
Otherwise they 're very good . 
Yeah , thanks . 
I 'm just trying to be a little friendly . 
Ought to be real easy to fix . 
I won 't give you a cent . 
I thought you had better sense . 
Oh , I 'm so glad you came in . 
You were the beast , Stanley , a dear good little beast . 
But the new superintendent is much nicer . 
Good luck . 
For heaven 's sake , about what ? 
A gold medal , a pat on the back , a free ticket home ? 
You presented that evidence brilliantly . 
And I 'm proud of you . 
A promising career is nipped in the bud . 
She 's doing Pete and me a great favor . 
He won 't be home for hours . 
If you don 't care for the program , turn off the set . 
Thank you ! 
I don 't care about the door . 
My friend here is taking me home with him tonight . 
I won 't be able to because I won 't be here . 
You should be in there dancing , enjoying yourself . 
Yes , sir . 
Won 't you lie down for a bit before dinner ? 
And he 's a big , strong fellow . 
I won 't . 
Every pleasure costs something . 
I don 't care how or where I get it . 
I 'm quite sure that Mrs. Crump was only making a joke . 
Yes . 
I would have been happy to be engaged forever . 
Oh , thank heaven ! 
All right , not murder , maybe just a little larceny , huh ? 
You happy now ? 
I don 't care about myself . 
But I won 't let you down this time , I promise . 
That 's pretty much an actor 's dream , isn 't it ? 
Yes , that 's right . 
Yes . 
Yes , he could . 
Would you care for a cup of tea ? 
Honest , I didn 't . 
Yes , sir , that 's right . 
But I promise you on my honor the truth will be out next time . 
Yes , that 's right . 
Yes , sir . 
Yes . 
Pretty girl like you making like this . 
Manny , I just want you to stay alive . 
Sometimes , I wish Minnie weren 't in your life at all . 
I think it 's the only thing that makes her happy . 
It won 't ever happen . 
Yes , so it might . 
Better not . 
Oh , you are such a good man . 
Oh , yes . 
Oh , that 's very good , sir , isn 't it ? 
Would you care to tell me about it ? 
Yes , that 's right . 
I 'd like to taste fine stuff like that . 
And your nice coat is all spotted ! 
It should make you feel kind of peaceful . 
Help , help ! 
You seem so positive we 're dealing with just one man . 
Yes 
But I 'll save telling that for some nice , stormy night , huh ? 
" I want to let you be free to lead your own life . 
Darling . 
Well , if I take a drink or two , it 's to help me arthritis . 
Well then , somebody better tell Mr. Weems . 
One of my dear friends sent me this . 
Ed , tell me it ain 't true . 
Yes , have they ? 
All right , not murder , maybe just a little larceny , huh ? 
You happy now ? 
I don 't care about myself . 
But I won 't let you down this time , I promise .

You presented that evidence brilliantly . 
A promising career is nipped in the bud . 
Thank you ! 
My friend here is taking me home with him tonight . 
Every pleasure costs something . 
A perfect description of Sylvia . 
This is a non- profit organization . 
Tomorrow will be better . 
I hope you will join us . 
Yes ? 
Mr. Bliss never made lady wait before . 
Sir Robert was very convincing . 
Yes , I know he was . 
Like she was going to a party . 
you can sit yourself down comfortably and relax ? 
Well , then , if you have definite evidence , go to the ... 
May God comfort them . 
Thank goodness I remembered . 
Now , darling , you know why I did this . 
Thanks , Mr. Piper . 
Yes , what have you got against me ? 
Yes , why not ? 
Yes , I read it in the paper . 
On the contrary I was very pleased . 
Live longer than your talents . 
something far more precious . 
How can one expect to learn the reason for love ? 
I would , with pleasure . 
She deluded herself into thinking that he was in love with her . 
It wouldn 't help . 
You can trust me . 
Yes . 
Oh , I won 't . 
We 're glad to have you .

What , darling ? 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Yes . 
Never quite fit the pattern , did I ? 
like thunder on a clear day . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
You better bring in some wood from the shed , Ben . 
You mean all of this is over a hand of poker ? 
You ain 't very bright , are you , kid ? 
That 's better than shooting you down . 
Just one favor , that 's all . 
We 'd get a nice , quiet little place in the country . 
I loved her . 
I was perfectly well on the boat . 
I almost wish we had gone straight to England instead . 
But you see the medicine must be prepared with great care . 
Oh , good heavens . 
Meanwhile , number 254 is a very nice room . 
However , if you wish to go and inquire at other hotels .... 
Why won 't they tell me anything ? 
Good night . 
Danny 's got friends . 
Isn 't it lovely ? 
What do you expect , three cheers ? 
Thank God . 
I 'll take care of Don this time . 
I 'd rather be lucky than good . 
Superior playing . 
Yes . 
I think you know that better than anybody else , Mrs. Sutton . 
Yes . 
You will be relieved to hear there was nothing wrong with it . 
" We wish to thank you for the patience you have shown ... 
We keep this place in good shape . 
Give me a hand here , will you ? 
Honey , take it easy , sweetheart . 
I won 't be needing any milk for a while . 
Look , I 'll bring you a good plane , a small one . 
So I thought I 'd save you that long trip on the subway . 
We 'll be just in time for a good hot dinner at the shelter . 
You know , Mr. Sears , you really do look like Santa Claus now . 
Perhaps his taste in ties has improved . 
You 've been wonderful , Lyle . 
I do wish you 'd give up the idea . 
These objects play an important part in tonight 's tale . 
Yes , sir . 
I 'm afraid that won 't be necessary . 
You know that I 'm good for an alibi if the price is right . 
Well , good evening , gentlemen . 
Yes , Mr. Barney . 
I got me some choice words you 'd appreciate . 
I 'd better get Mike back in here for you . 
Your husband won 't be back till late . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
See if I care ! 
Living in a tenement on a day like this is living boiled alive . 
Not if I can help it . 
Maybe , we better go to her husband . 
But you do want me to look beautiful for you , don 't you ? 
You haven 't had a winner for three weeks . 
Thanks to you and your friend , he hasn 't got a dime . 
Well , happy days . 
Oh , yes . 
I think we are fortunate that we found out in time . 
Doesn 't Hermione arrange things beautifully ? 
This is a time for rejoicing . 
But strong as an ox . 
Give him a good dinner . 
But I won 't . 
I 'm sure he 'll like you in that dress , too , madame . 
Come now , wine is good for the blood . 
I got a better idea . 
If you had telegraphed , it would have been easier . 
It 's the safest place in the world , Theodore . 
Why , yes . 
Yes , that would follow . 
You won 't let me have it , then ? 
You know it 's true . 
That 's an interesting question . 
I would find you delightful , all the rest of our days . 
It 'll be no great loss , I 'm sure . 
Yes , I found the book . 
Great . 
Oh , yes . 
Here 's the safety . 
Yes . 
Good night . 
You ain 't a nice girl like I thought . 
No one else ever thought I was as beautiful as you do . 
I loved her so much . 
But you 'd appreciate my getting to the point . 
I can help you find him . 
No one else ever thought I was as beautiful as you do . 
Yes , that 's right . 
But I think it 's best if we never see each other again . 
Yes . 
Good night . 
He trusted me and now I 've let him down . 
Yes ? 
Thanks , anyway . 
You 'd better stay here . 
Oh , thank heavens , Lieutenant . 
After a week of this , it 's a wonder we 're not all sick . 
Take our friend here . 
Help me . 
To the likes of you , maybe . 
You want me to take it easy ?

I want to be as free as you to live my life ... and forget China . 
I 'll get my freedom as soon as we return . 
You won 't like that . 
After all , you 're quite happy as you are . 
Oh , how good it is to be alive .

I don 't knoW What you used to look like , but clean it first . 
I saved that fat guy . 
Good idea . 
Mom has to check it very clear . 
She seems to be quite happy . 
Ok , I Will fulfill you Wish . 
Wait for another better chance , let 's go .

Fat Goose , help Keung over here . 
I just won 't deal with Wilkison . 
Needed or not , he 's dead . 
- I sure hope you know what you 're doing . 
It 's weight , strength , and endurance that count . 
- Yes ? 
I 'd like to know what good it 's ever done . 
- Is this salt free for the taking ? 
- I was told this salt 's free for the taking . 
Spud , let 's see how good you can use that rope . 
Maybe this won 't be the kind of work you like . 
I respect them . 
I know the United States Cavalry . 
I thought he 'd take it better from you than me . 
All the more reason he needs your help . 
Hand it over . 
And if I do , it 's only because I love you . 
Take care of my boy .

Ooh- ooh , this is a good one ! 
Ernie , she loves you .

Bilko 's little stranger won . 
You look gray , positively gray . 
" I always liked Ernie . " 
Well , it 's a natural ... 
She 's a lovely girl . 
Oh , she 's just my sweetheart . 
Sarge , I had 50 bucks right here in my hand . 
Sergeant Bilko won 't find out . 
Thank heavens I have Blue Cross .

Have fun . 
Yes . 
Especially a beneficiary . 
Boys , Beast wants to say good night !

They won 't be leaving for Panama until after your show is over . 
Think it over , darling . 
May I help you , please ? 
- Good luck , Johnny . 
- Take it easy . 
- He 's a friend . 
That guy was so in love with you he couldn 't see straight . 
Thanks a lot . 
I 'm very grateful to you for this additional information . 
I 'd better ask the vet to make it a little more palatable .

Why won 't she like you ? 
He 's an old hand at taking advantage ofgirls 
He loves only me 
- I won 't accept it ! 
But it wasn 't enough to stem ... awife 's love . 
It was a sacriflce , just to make the divorce easier

She won 't run from me 
Why won 't she like you ? 
He 's an old hand at taking advantage of girls 
He loves only me 
- I won 't accept it ! 
But it wasn 't enough to stem ... a wife 's love . 
This is a question ofwoman 's honour . 
He was saying ... his wife will save money ... 
It was a sacriflce , just to make the divorce easier 
Yeah , I think you should restrain your excitement . 
Samson my dear , this isn 't fair ! 
I 'll celebrate my marriage to beautiful Delilah . 
It 's really beautiful ! 
I respect you , but you must respect me all the same ! 
He 's great . 
Happiness is in a constant quarrel with art . 
We have an awesome artist . 
Yes , sir . 
I wish . 
Shut up , you were pretty good . 
Sincerely charming . 
Even if it lasts two years , it 's a great opportunity . 
Is that why you won 't hear me ? 
I told him not to go for a month but his nostalgia was stronger . 
Paid overtime , and cheers . 
And let 's go to the police station or the insurance won 't pay . 
And a proud one , baby ! 
Congratulations , Romero . 
That 's strange , he is usually very kind . 
I had my reasons to be , but , happily , it 's all over . 
Yes , Dad , right away . 
Thanks . 
Drinking alcohol doesn 't necessarily lead to a good time . 
Yes , for a long time now . 
There isn 't much hope . 
It 's not in vain , it 'll make me strong and independent .

The foot soldiers won the last war , and they 'll win the next . 
Good day , Billy . 
I 'm proud of you . 
- Not if the statement 's true . 
In fact , it 's very good . 
Yes . 
Please , I wish you wouldn 't . 
Yes . 
[ Spectators Laugh ] 
We saved the girl . 
- I trust you all right ... as far as I can spit ! 
Colonel ... you are a man who keeps faith with his ideals . 
You 're a funny one . 
She was in love with some guy she dreamed up , not me ! 
Your father was a great man . 
All my French Canucks are good , honest boys . 
I have only seemed wonderful because things I could not give you , 
Good day , sir . 
But , French , we are proud of our heritage . 
This time , the pleasure 's all mine . 
- What 's needed here is -- - An influential personality . 
- Help me , Minister ! 
They 've succeeded in their intent . 
I wish they would ! 
So you want some advice to help you with your search . 
On the other hand , I 'll bet Mario couldn 't care less . 
I won 't say a word . 
It 's the only fun she has here in Piovarolo . 
- Good heavens , what 'll I do ? 
- We must inform His Excellency . 
She was better in spring . 
You told me she 's as good as my sister . 
Omasu was frank and good to me before . 
We should be kind to her . 
Help yourselves . 
I 'm glad you have understood . 
Yes , a little . 
Be strong and try to recover . 
She was better in spring . 
You told me she 's as good as my sister . 
Omasu was frank and good to me untill now . 
We should be kind to her . 
Please , help yourselves . 
I 'm glad you have understood . 
Yes , a little . 
They 're both a couple of nice healthy youngsters . 
Good , that 's the kind of talk I like to hear . 
Now , you don 't think people aren 't grateful ? 
Maybe I don 't care to think much , either , Pat . 
He won 't join up . 
Better get along . 
Good night . 
Yes , it is , Ellie . 
It won 't make anyone else happy up top , either . 
- Yes , it is . 
He 's unconscious , but still alive . 
John , for the last time , please won 't you stay here ? 
On a plea of self- defense till he buys himself a pardon . 
Innocent people will be shot down and what good will it do ? 
You have no real love for me . 
I 'm safe and you 're my dearest Dad . 
So salt is still more precious than gold ? 
like a kitten ! 
Help ! 
I 'll act the clown and make you laugh . 
I like to be liked . 
They won 't find anything ... 
I always thought I loved only Dad . 
A good heart has room for all people of good will . 
But you make good hot grog ! 
I 'd be happier if it would be fully paid for . 
Give her my best anyway . 
- Oh , but I 'm very happy as I am . 
Thanks for accompanying me . 
Goodness , it 's strong . 
Scum like him is never forgotten . 
Wow . 
Good luck selling it as a crime of passion . 
Sounds good . 
Sounds good . 
These early attempts met with varying degrees of success .

What do you expect , three cheers ? 
Thank God . 
When she showed up naked , I saw her , not an enemy soldier . 
THE LOVERS OF THE TEJO 
OK , she can come . 
I love crowds , M. Rouvier . 
What could be better ? 
You were a good man on one side of the door . 
- Is he your lover ? 
You won 't have her , Lewis . 
It 's because I 'm happy . 
- Yes , I ... 
- I hope so for your sake . 
That 's probably why he 's playing so well . 
Yes . 
The best passports are made by the Bank of England . 
I wish he 'd talked to us before he went into China . 
Ain 't she wonderful ? 
Maybe I 'd better carry you up the stairs . 
The navy was glad to get rid of me . 
Then he should be easy to find because he will not move . 
- He is your friend ? 
Yes , I know , so be careful . 
Oh , that 's perfectly all right . 
Yes , I guess you 're right . 
- I can 't help it . 
My joys were all over 
God bless my virility ! 
Have mercy ! 
You act smart with me ? 
But this medal wasn 't mine , Inspector . 
Yes , that 's how it is .

After Bengal and Bihar , to raise money for the charity fund ...

Forgive me , dear ... 
I only want to chant the name of the Lord Praise the Lord ... 
You can act smart in your house . 
Wow !

Here 's one for luck . 
- Be a good girl and go home . 
The best thing to do is to rest . 
Gotta be strong to bear it . 
- That 's the thanks I get . 
What happened to the party ? 
What good would it do you ? 
Very noble . 
The , uh , Navy appreciates your attitude , Mr. Craig . 
I could recommend a good psychiatrist . 
I 'll be around for some more of those free treatments . 
Oh , now , come on , relax . 
The mind is a very funny thing . 
I got feelings , and I got respect where it 's due . 
I love you like your mother does . 
You 're better off than a fish with these snorkels . 
Only my dignity . 
He was such a nice guy . 
Otherwise you won 't get an applause . 
Well then , wait for whom won 't come ! 
- Yes , with the motorbike . 
- Listen , you won 't see me anymore ! 
- Many thanks . 
Ah , yes ... 
- Will you tell me something kind ? 
Give me a hand , let 's take her up ! 
If Holy Mother doesn 't help me ... 
I 'm not a villain ! 
It 's good for you to know this . 
- Bye , sweetie . 
Are you satisfied or do you want some more ?

I 'll do all I can to help you , Sturgess . 
Yes , I see . 
Good night . 
I don 't care . 
Honey , please , please try to take it easy . 
- Yes , that 's right . 
Dear God , help her . 
I know , but I like to pick out the flaws . 
Nothing serious , but I 'd better talk to you about it . 
You 've got a better angle . 
What , darling ? 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Yes . 
Never quite fit the pattern , did I ? 
like thunder on a clear day . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
You better bring in some wood from the shed , Ben . 
You mean all of this is over a hand of poker ? 
You ain 't very bright , are you , kid ? 
That 's better than shooting you down . 
Just one favor , that 's all . 
We 'd get a nice , quiet little place in the country . 
I loved her . 
I was perfectly well on the boat . 
I almost wish we had gone straight to England instead . 
But you see the medicine must be prepared with great care . 
Oh , good heavens . 
Meanwhile , number 254 is a very nice room . 
However , if you wish to go and inquire at other hotels .... 
Why won 't they tell me anything ? 
Good night . 
Danny 's got friends . 
Isn 't it lovely ? 
I 'll take care of Don this time . 
I 'd rather be lucky than good . 
Superior playing . 
Yes . 
I think you know that better than anybody else , Mrs. Sutton . 
Yes . 
You will be relieved to hear there was nothing wrong with it . 
" We wish to thank you for the patience you have shown ... 
We keep this place in good shape . 
Give me a hand here , will you ? 
Honey , take it easy , sweetheart . 
I won 't be needing any milk for a while . 
Look , I 'll bring you a good plane , a small one . 
So I thought I 'd save you that long trip on the subway . 
We 'll be just in time for a good hot dinner at the shelter . 
You know , Mr. Sears , you really do look like Santa Claus now . 
Perhaps his taste in ties has improved . 
You 've been wonderful , Lyle . 
I do wish you 'd give up the idea . 
Yes , indeed . 
Hand me that check , please . 
- They won 't hear about it . 
- I 'd better do something . 
- Well , look , why don 't you just relax ? 
Well , I think you two are going to like marriage . 
Pretty nice along the seams . 
He 's worked out a plan , great plan . 
- Sure , sure , you had it tough . 
Hey , that 'd boost your legal career real good , wouldn 't it ? 
Yes , I will . 
It 's nice here ! 
I just didn 't think you cared . 
- Isabella looked beautiful today . 
You 're cheating on me with my best friend . 
Good . 
The least I can do is see you 're rewarded ! 
Good . 
Good night , gentlemen ! 
I love you more than any principle . 
We 'd like to ask you and your family to forgive us .

He deserves medical help 
He could never even express his love "

I got something worked out but I need your help 
You 're a nice guy . 
You won 't will you ?

Could you let me have a couple of boys to help me in the fields ?

Please , take care of my beans . 
I 've been pretty busy . 
You 're a good foreman , Jube . 
I got a mite of curiosity and a heap of faith ... 
If we want to win it back , we 'd better get on with the game . 
No matter if you love me ? 
Since the day Jube come here , Pinky ain 't liked him . 
I love him . 
We 're people of peace . 
I killed my best friend . 
If they take you , you can 't help yourself . 
He 's not going to hurt you anymore , Mae .

" Captain , friends . 
- Good thing , too ! 
- What good are you then ? 
- I 'm not a coward ! 
Old lady , glad you made it ! 
We ought to be grateful that we 're just locked up here . 
That 's the same kind that monk had .

This is very interesting . 
I 'm trying to help clear up his affairs . 
He won 't . 
- Yes . 
This is very interesting . 
I 'm trying to help clear up his affairs . 
I 'm quite sure he won 't . 
- Yes . 
This is very interesting . 
I 'm trying to help clear up his affairs . 
Lucy , darling , I really think you ought to go to bed .

Everyone 's laughing at us ! 
I can 't help myself ... 
I hope we 'll be friends . 
You knew I 'd play it down so you had to show off ! 
If you love me . 
But I 'm not a bastard . 
Why didn 't he go with his friend ? 
Everyone 's laughing at us !

Thanks , Lou . 
He feels just wonderful . 
Oh , thanks , Ed , for taking over for me . 
Should have known better than to take it . 
Go back to bed , darling .

I gave up a promising career just to be his partner . 
Can I help it if it didn 't take any brains to fix it ? 
Duffer 's back , and he understands the situation better . 
No , I love him . 
Okay , hand it over . 
" Please try not to worry . 
And don 't try anything funny . 
We 've got to get help . 
Y- yes , captain ? 
You 'd' ve made a wonderful girl . 
Filling my head with fairy stories of a romantic lover . 
Or perchance a brilliant combination of both . 
Yes , master . 
Ah , be he king or peasant , my ready blade will find its mark ! 
It must not fail . 
And by whose hand ? 
What do you mean you love another ? 
Our love makes me strong . 
Well that 's very considerate of you , my dear . 
Yes , wh- what 's ... how does one catch this thing ? 
Yes . 
You 'll not die , you 'll not have to fight him . 
The chalice from the palace has the brew that is true ! 
The vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true !

[ Laughing ] 
Like all jolly good fellows 
This the last day , yes ? 
He 's not dead ! 
Can I help you , Captain ? 
He 's not dead ! 
And your heart sounds pretty good . 
That 's a very good idea about the research endowment . 
Pretty close to a hundred . 
You think I loved that old woman ? 
Aren 't you interested in this project ? 
I could get better than that out of my six- year- old son . 
These are very intelligent men you 'll be talking to . 
Yes , I 've heard . 
Making love without emotion . 
You 've got great hands . 
We 'll be the greatest in the business . 
Always looking for something good . 
When this engagement ends , you 're out . 
- You can 't even begin to see her clearly ! 
Tomorrow we make it perfect . 
Most kind of you , but an evening in Paris is always a pleasure .

I hope you will keep this interview as brief as possible . 
It 's for ya own good . 
You were young and very much in love . 
Then let 's call them years of a friendly misalliance . 
- On the contrary , I loved you . 
What a success you 'd be as an actor . 
You know , you really are funny . 
Good morning . 
We 'll go out tonight , that 'll cheer you up . 
If they 're on their way we 'd better get the plans . 
Who cares about schoolteachers ?

One of the best night 's sleep I ever had was in a boxcar . 
Honey , nothing 's illegal if they don 't catch you . 
I 'm not in the business to make them happy .

" What good are fancy cars , long journeys and luxury hotels ? 
Leaving all this good stuff . 
But they saved me . 
He was the ultimate in charm . 
You could almost imagine him putting his hand in his shirt . 
" about miracles and divine grace . " 
Fellini told me that by agreement with Dino De Laurentiis ... 
I saw him two days later , and he was feeling a little better . 
Fellini acted very kindly . 
I wrote him a letter that he liked .

Then I paint something funny . 
I want to confess as best I can ... but my heart is void . 
Most people think neither of Death nor nothingness . 
Now bounding with glee 
A profitable trade nowadays . 
We were too well- off , too satisfied . 
I was in good faith . 
Funny , aren 't you ? 
You are funny . 
It 's better to be two . 
It is like loving someone in the dark ... who never answers . 
Best to kill them while the fun lasts . 
- " Why don 't you kiss me ? " 
Love is the blackest of all plagues . 
I 'll thank you afterwards ! 
I played that scene well . 
Then you are eight brave men . 
Help me ! 
- Yes , he dances away with them all . 
- That won 't make them happier . 
- Yes , I want to . 
Oh , yes ... 
The best stuff ; blood and guts of a big black dog . 
It 's quite a rewarding domain these days . 
- but have mercy on us for the sake of your Son , Jesus Christ ! 
You 're more beautiful without make- up . 
- You don 't look happy . 
- It 's better when you are a couple . 
- Our game amuses me . 
- " Why don 't you kiss me ? " 
- Love is the blackest of all plagues . 
Take my hand . 
Dear friend , I lower this dagger to my breast . 
I 've almost never seen such a dead actor .

laughs at himself , and smiles at the girls . 
It 's the best remedy : 
We were too well- off , too satisfied with ourselves . 
A more suitable and rewarding occupation for scoundrels . 
I saved your life ! 
You 're funny . 
People don 't look kindly on those kinds of tales . 
It 's always better being a couple .

Beautiful weather . 
You and Evald must make the best of it . " 
I have liked having you about the house . 
It 's a nice manly smell .

I think it 's a splendid idea . 
You 'd better get a man with younger arteries . 
You 'll like Brogan- Moore , he 's had excellent training . 
- This is perfectly all right . 
- When I left her she was alive ! 
That 's perfectly all right . 
You better go . 
But it 's getting better . 
- Yes , sir . 
Yes . 
I am sure that many agree with you . 
It was gratitude , then , that prompted you to give him an alibi 
I never killed anybody ! 
Don 't make me laugh . 
My objection then was overruled by Mr Justice Swindon . 
Members of the jury , are you all agreed upon your verdict ? 
You 'd better wait here until we get rid of that crowd , madam . 
- Well , it won 't be for life , will it ? 
That can 't be true ! 
- Thanks , gentleman . 
It will like Brogan- Moore , has had an excellent preparation . 
Good , that late I happened to see it on the eight . 
- Wise that was the free day of the master ? 
Vole , is not bad , is terrible . 
But it is improving . 
Thanks , doctor . 
Thanks . 
No , I did not kill it ! 
Good night , Sir Wilfrid . 
Déjela peacefully ! 
Calm , calm .

One more kiss and he 'd fall apart . 
Have you ever loved anyone ? 
- Father Galli , I need your help . 
- I think the busts are rather handsome . 
It 's very funny , really , happening to me like this . 
The great Passini reads books . 
Get the ambulances ready ! 
A good thing to know . 
Alive ! 
- I 'm not sick , I 'm wounded ! 
I leave you in good hands . 
That 'll create a splendid impression . 
- How 's your hero ? 
Always isn 't a pretty word . 
We always feel good when we 're together . 
It 's true . 
Darling ... 
I 've made a separate peace . 
A beautiful expectant mother . 
It feels wonderful . 
- Yes . 
- Good , that 's what I want too . 
He 's wonderful . 
Don 't mind me , darling . 
Yes . 
It 's been sweet . 
- I think it might be better if ... 
My darling . 
Darling . 
I said you don 't come back because Americans ... they too smart . 
- [ Laughs ] 
One more kiss ... 
Have you ever loved anyone ? 
I think the busts are rather handsome . 
Hey , the great Passini reads books , knows everything . 
A good thing to know . 
I 'm not sick . 
That 'll create a splendid impression . 
God , I wish I weren 't . 
- How 's your hero ? 
- [ Laughs ] 
It won 't . 
- " Always " isn 't a pretty word . 
We always feel good when we 're together . 
I know it , darling , but it isn 't nice to feel like one . 
- It 's true ! 
I made a separate peace . 
- Oh , I wish I 'd been with you ... 
A beautiful expectant mother . 
It feels wonderful ! 
- He 's wonderful . 
- Yes . 
She had a good time . 
Please , please , dear God ... don 't ... 
Darling , you will be good to me , won 't you ? 
Radar stations on Mountain tops ... 
Theoretically yes . 
Well it 's , doing the best it can . 
All over the United States this morning ... 
We better get going . 
Well , just about center of the right hand side . 
She 's of gentle birth . 
But who will benefit most from this ? 
You think there are only rich merchants in Prague ? 
Here , friend , have a drink . 
God protect you . 
They certainly have eternal joy now . 
- This worldly robe suits you better . 
I won 't yield . 
Zdena , come to burn with love ! 
Our men won 't hold ! 
They chase you like a herd of animals !

With a priest and a woman to protect ... you , you do okay . 
Easy . 
That ain 't true . 
Now matter how s ... smart we figure it . 
So , if they know what 's good for 'em , they 'll stay away . 
He isn 't easy to get along with . 
Right pretty woman , your ma was . 
Why , because you liked Jacob better ?

Oh , great . 
- Easy , son , easy .

Easy . 
Oh , great . 
- Easy , son , easy . 
I 'm so glad I can say it at last 
There 's a good girl ! 
I 'm not lying , I 'm not . 
They got jewels and gold there . 
I 'm not lying ! 
Honest 
It didn 't do those three any good .

You cook good coffee . 
I 'd sure wish you 'd buy me some striped candy . 
- You cook good coffee . 
I 'd sure wish you 'd buy me some striped candy . 
- You cook good coffee . 
I 'd sure wish you 'd buy me some striped candy . 
- You cook good coffee . 
Glad to hear he 's doing so well . 
Good morning , Mr. Summerton . 
He 's not going to kill me . 
You won 't live long enough to get another . 
I fell in love with Sundown the first time I saw it . 
I was hoping you 'd stopped by to thank me . 
What happened between you and your friend ? 
Sam never hurt anybody in his life . 
Glad to hear he 's doing so well .

Ask your precious cousin about Uncle Charlie . 
I thought it best to keep him here . 
Save your strength , Mr. Davenport . 
He was under a doctor 's care . 
Davenport took care of that himself . 
Good afternoon . 
You know , you 're a pretty good actor . 
Won 't work . 
Not at this time , Your Honour . 
I did it because I loved Martha . 
You 'd better go to the police . 
I won 't . 
Anything interesting in the paper ? 
At the expense of a friend ? 
I had that wonderful feeling of being free . 
- Happy , huh ? 
The least we can do is show him a little respect . 
What makes you so sure you 've got the right people ? 
Yes . 
I never can resist the plea of a lovely woman . 
Won 't you sit down ? 
- I 'll be in good company . 
You 're wise beyond your years , young man , and a good guesser . 
Yes . 
Nothing good can come of it . 
- Nadine is a sweet child . 
- Yes . 
Well , um , there was other evidence to support my opinion . 
I reckon I had more faith in her lawyer than you did . 
I decided to trust my first instinct and call you . 
You 're a mighty pretty girl . 
Well , I thought there was nothing wrong with that Pim feller 's . 
Yes . 
But if I were you , I wouldn 't trust him too far . 
I only wanted to help my father . 
Big help I 've been . 
Your own ever- loving , huh ? 
Is that your opinion or do you know it for a positive fact ? 
Yes , sir . 
Oh , yes . 
- Who are his close friends ? 
I can take care of myself . 
Yes , sir . 
Lucky for your client that Mrs. Greeley confessed . 
I can 't help you . 
I want to thank you very much , Mr. Aldritch . 
Good night , counsellor . 
Yes . 
- Yes . 
Yes . 
If -- If you 'd care to see copies of my letters to her ... 
So when I read in your advertisement that you were rich , 
But if you are half as pretty as you say , 
- Yes . 
It sure looks like it . 
She found out he don 't love her no more . 
Della , I love you . 
Would it help you to talk a little ? 
- How will that help ? 
Yes , Your Honour . 
With enthusiasm . 
If I can 't make you happy , maybe somebody else can . 
Yes , Mrs. Kirby . 
Yes . 
- Yes . 
Yes . 
That concludes the case for the People , Your Honour . 
Surely this matter won 't be tried in a criminal court . 
We only serve entertainment , food and drinks . 
Now , that 's the funniest line of the year . 
With any luck . 
Oh , me , what did I do to deserve such popularity ? 
You 're the only one I love . 
You have what looks like a well- documented case . 
- Doris keeps hoping . 
Pretty well done on that side , Mrs. Shelby . 
- Yes . 
I won 't go to the gas chamber for anybody . 
- Good work , Quincey . 
You know perfectly well who we are . 
Definitely , sir . 
In his hand was Lisa 's medallion . 
Your letters certainly sound like it . 
- Good night , Mr. Conway . 
- Good night . 
Your beautiful theory right out the window . 
I wouldn 't have cared if he 'd been skewered alive . 
Yes . 
I got you a good job , didn 't I ? 
Wasn 't very smart . 
Well , thank you . 
- Easy , Mr. Cole . 
- Hi , beautiful . 
I honestly don 't know . 
And with your help , of course . 
Good night . 
We feel we serve the cause of justice . 
Won 't you sit down ? 
I think we 'd better tell him the truth , Connie . 
I think I 'm entitled to use dynamite . 
- Yes , Your Honour . 
She didn 't care what she could do . 
- Please , I -- - It was part of the excitement , isn 't it ? 
And I 'll tell you something else about my precious husband . 
Better luck next time , as they say . 
We 're very happy with your work . 
Definitely not . 
I 'll do my best , Perry . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
- Thanks again , Mr. Mason . 
Here , I got you one of those nice cushy jobs . 
Yes . 
I want you to protect her . 
It 's a pretty solid case now . 
I 'm so clever , I put a noose right around Stephanie 's neck . 
You must have a most fascinating job . 
Thanks , Mr. Drake . 
He could very easily wind up in the gas chamber . 
I could say no , but it wouldn 't be true . 
Well , I honestly couldn 't say . 
Well , a silencer of some kind might 've , uh , been used on it . 
I think we 've had enough excitement for one night . 
Anything interesting this bleak Monday morning ? 
Good morning , Mr. Allred . 
And if he doesn 't , well , what do we gain ? 
- But why are you so sure ? 
Overbrook didn 't know me , so I figured I 'd be safe . 
[ ALL CHUCKLE ] 
You 've been very kind . 
Better call Homicide , Tom . 
Yes , it 's mine . 
Yes , I understand that . 
Yes , I guess you 're right . 
Are you positive your caller was a man ? 
I object , Your Honour . 
I just made sure that we were never alone together . 
Your Honour . 
Does the defence wish to make a motion ? 
Your uncle 's perfectly all right . 
Now , wouldn 't that state of mind be perfectly natural ? 
- Now , honey , I -- - Sweetie . 
Good girl . 
Yes , it is . 
- Yes . 
Enjoying the view ? 
Congratulations , Mason . 
- Yes , sir , twice . 
This enquiry 's getting pretty far afield . 
Well , as you can imagine , I 've sheltered her a great deal . 
Another detective might help you . 
So is justice , which was carried out . 
I think you can help me find out who did . 
- Oh , yes , I recall . 
" Just good friends . " 
- You sure you won 't come in ? 
Better get Williams and go out there in a prowl car . 
- Hope I didn 't spoil it for you . 
Now , Tulloch , be sure and put it in a good , safe place . 
Too rich for my blood . 
Little old Bob will take care of everything . 
Good night . 
Mildred Kimber needs your help . 
- Come on , easy , now . 
Congratulations , Mason . 
No , the roads are pretty well dried out . 
She wiped it clean after Clement shoved off . 
I 'd be glad to join you . 
Thanks for the lunch . 
I loved him . 
I see pretty girls all the time in my work . 
Mr. Addison must be very proud to have a friend like you . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
I put out my hand to help him up . 
Oh , we made such a wonderful team . 
Yes . 
I wiped off the fingerprints and placed it in Charles ' hand . 
Yes . 
Oh , of course you didn 't , darling . 
Yes , I know . 
Sheriff , I want to thank you for your cooperation . 
Yes . 
Perhaps you 'd better tell us about it . 
Yes , if it worked out . 
I wasn 't sure my alibi was right , but it was my only hope then . 
It 's probably the best approach , Breel . 
I loved him , I -- 
Yes . 
Then there 's grand theft , bunco . 
We 've got an agreement . 
I think her niece , Eva Martell , can be of some help to you . 
Oh , yes , I can . 
Yes , sir . 
It won 't do any good . 
Well , I wish you 'd said something . 
Yes , that 's right . 
No , you were perfectly right . 
The morphine was in my hand . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
I 'll be necessary for him to raise his left hand . 
Look , would it help any if I flew down to Los Angeles ? 
I realize that , Your Honor . 
With profound respect , Senator Baylor . " 
Would you care to tell meyourside of it ? 
Nice and big and fat and clear . 
Yes , the evening papers say I 'm being sought . 
They weren 't so lucky there . 
Yes , sir . 
Yes . 
How can you be positive it wasn 't , lieutenant ? 
Then with a twist of the hand , the slack was taken up . 
Yes , sir . 
Yes . 
Danny , your biggest laughs you ever got were from ad libs . 
If it 'll make it any clearer , yes ! 
What makes you so sure ? 
" $100, 000 to establish a trust fund 
I did not murder Mr. Baxter . 
( light , pleasant music playing ) 
That 's true . 
And everybody makes a profit . 
Yes , sir . 
I 'd better get in touch with Paul . 
We were a great team . 
Well , why would a guy make up a story like that ? 
Yes . 
Perhaps you 'd better get it over with . 
And that pleases you ? 
Well , frankly , I don 't care one way or the other . 
I thought by this time that Mr. Burger would be free . 
Yes , sir . 
Yes , sir . 
Yes , Your Honor , I am . 
She 's a nice kid . 
I note you were very interested in the Volponi case . 
" Steve , laughing : " ' Old murders make fascinating plays . ' 
You know as well as I , it was not you who killed Royce . 
Why you -- Yes ! 
I think it 's safe to assume that it has . 
Better shut the door . 
Your Honor , none of this was covered on direct examination . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
I 'm not planning a capital crime . 
You 'd better ask for Lieutenant Tragg . 
Yes , sir . 
Come on , you better get started . 
Are you positive ? 
Yes . 
I came by it honestly . 
Yes , sir . 
He most certainly did . 
I can 't help it , can I , if she didn 't like them ? 
We had an agreement . 
Oh , Your Honor , I object . 
Although it means giving up your great- grandson ? 
My strength came only once , Mother . 
This change in the weather hasn 't done it any good . 
You just run along and have a good time . 
Your Honor ! 
You weren 't very fond of his son . 
You satisfied now ? 
Hi , beautiful . 
I just remembered I was supposed to take care of 
Well , I 'm sure your Mr. Drake can find him . 
Would $25, 000 help to override your concern ? 
Well , what 's the verdict ? 
I 'm sure she 'll appreciate it just the same . 
I wish ... ( sighs ) 
Thank you for your help , and thank you for the tea . 
Yes , sir , it has my identifying mark on it . 
I object , Your Honor . 
I think she cares more for money than anything in life . 
Your jokes aren 't very funny right now , Livesey . 
As I said , he has a perfect alibi . 
We 'd better find out . 
Better get your shoes on . 
And in another way , it 's a clever story . 
Your Honor ... 
Yes ! 
There won 't be any answer . 
Were you in love with your husband ? 
Mrs. Prescott stood to gain $75, 000 ? 
Well , certainly not ! 
And pretty far afield . 
He just thought he was being smart . 
I have an excellent ear . 
I can 't help it if Anderson looked me up . 
But any case , you 're being very helpful . 
I have a wonderful wife and two lovely daughters . 
On my word of honor , Mr. Mason , I didn 't . 
Yes , sir . 
It 's a nice layout you have here . 
I should have drawn her out , won her confidence . 
Oh , yes , there is . 
Could I help the flat tire ? 
I 'm glad you 've calmed down . 
Maybe I better write some of this down . 
Yes , honey , there is . 
Well ... maybe we 'd better sit down for a minute . 
Yes , fairly accurately , as it happens . 
He 's gonna clean it up . 
You better finish your lunch , Danny , you 'll be late for class . 
I hope so . 
Suppose Bright Magic was doped , Eddie ? 
Yes , sir . 
Your Honor , don 't you think Mr. Mason -- ? 
Yes . 
Certainly not over that beating . 
Well , I 've got a little surprise for you . 
I don 't think I 'll ever be happy again as long as you live . 
That 's all the more reason not to involve an innocent party . 
I 'm just curious as to how well you knew him . 
Don 't play innocent . 
Yes , you 're right . 
He feels he has a great talent . 
He promised , Your Honor . 
lf you think this is an aisle ... ... l assure you it 's not ! 
They 're like orphanage runaways ! 
Pick me a good one now ! 
Thankfully , this gentleman ... 
Õ ou must be at peace now , general ... 
Tano , you know I am innocent ! 
Ordinarily , the natives on this island are peaceful enough . 
Such a nice polite fellow . 
Why don 't you admit you love me ? 
Nargu has many friends in the tribe . 
In good time . 
Good ! 
Thanks . 
Help ! 
We 've got to help these people . 
I won 't say a word . 
Thank God ! 
That 's a good sign . 
- It won 't be this time . 
Yes , Martin . 
Lift him up easy . 
That won 't make any difference . 
I just think it 'd be safer if we had somebody else . 
This is safer than being with the coach . 
That 's thoughtful of you , friend . 
You made a nice try . 
Lift him up easy . 
That won 't make any difference .

Another British group tried their luck in 1923 . 
She wants the jewels for herself . 
I came to help him return to dust , to find his eternal rest . 
I wish I knew . 
- Help ! 
- He won 't get far with those diamonds . 
I know him better than you . 
Yes , it 's true . 
Yes , yes . 
Yes . 
- Yes , no one can act like you . 
- Poppe , you know you are my friend . 
Is it you , my friend ? 
- Good morning . 
That wasn 't so good . 
I 'll take care of everything . 
- Yes . 
- Great . 
It 'll be great to wear proper clothes again . 
Well , this isn 't top- secret . 
Yes ? 
Well , that 's something you have to survive , like , uh , 
Be good to see them again . 
I left you to save them . 
Cheerful Charlie . 
[ laughing ] 
Welcome to the club . 
( Brand ) Don 't you try to save me . 
- Yes ? 
That 's something you have to survive , like love . 
Be good to see them again . 
- I left you to save them . 
- Cheerful Charlie . 
Better and better . 
Welcome to the club . 
Don 't you try to save me . 
I suppose he would have said , " Tell Jane I love her . " 
- Yes ? 
That 's something you have to survive , like love .

Well , I hope you did something useful with it . 
Elections of any kind are fucking bourgeois affectation . 
Good luck with all that . 
Okay , so make it brilliant . 
Yeah , I 'm good with that . 
Okay , okay ! 
It 's good to see you , Dan . 
Listen , I did something else too , I hope you don 't mind . 
Yeah , she 's a good friend of Lucy 's . 
You were great , you were just great . 
On a nice day like this , you want to fight ? 
Well , we don 't care . 
Listen , I did something else too , I hope you don 't mind . 
Yeah , she 's a good friend of Lucy 's . 
Hey , that 's great . 
You were great , you were just great .

Well , we don 't care . 
I 've heard a lot about you , lover- boy . 
Sold to the highest bidder , our charming hostess , Mrs. Simpson . 
She won 't go for it . 
- Good morning , Mr. Boss . 
Come now , Beauty . 
Maybe because it feels so good the night before .

Your shop they won 't organize . 
He 's trying to save your life .

Great , the perfect qualification . 
Well , there 's nothing to be confused about . 
When you get to my shoulder , you have to kiss me on the lips . 
I didn 't have sense enough to know that I 'm not a failure . 
Louella Parsons says it 's true . 
These are wonderful lipsticks 
Take good care of that girl . 
It 's nice . 
You 're doing great , Mr. Monk .

What role do I play in your paradise ? 
Good work ! 
I do not see what it was funny .

He amuses himself even here ? 
You make love to my wife ? 
It 's either money or love ! 
Yes , yes . 
Don 't you love me even a little bit ? 
I 'm sure they 'd love to know they carry your complaints ! 
You 're definitely not disappointed . 
I 'm young , I want to live , amuse myself ! 
Yes , in his office ! 
You can 't go out like that ! 
It 's a natural kindness to a fellow merchant . 
It 's nasty , but it 's true ! 
That 's nice for me , isn 't it ? 
You are definitely your mother 's daughter . 
None of that matters because you 've loved . 
At least we loved each other for a few months . 
Lovers form a unique couple in the world .

How dare you say a thing like that to my friend Roger ! 
You see , I 'm wise to you , Mr. Simmons . 
He got the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Croix de guerre . 
Yes , sir . 
You have talent . 
Lucky for you , sir , I 'm not a vindictive person . 
Jocko , that was a magnificent performance . 
He won 't know anything about it , sir . 
If you 're done , we 'd better move . 
You know how Ep likes everything proper . 
It 's that nobody loves you ? 
It 'll be safer . 
Good morning , Teacher . 
- After all , I 'm his favorite nephew . 
Oh , yes . 
I 'd better get home . 
- Good evening , Don Francisco . 
Yes , that was the reason he ordered his execution . 
Yes , I have something to say .

He was only trying to help , Comandante . 
Ah , Don Diego , you know my business better than l ? 
He will know someone will expect him to make the rescue attempt . 
It was only with the greatest effort that he was subdued . 
Zorro was an outlaw , but he never harmed the poor . 
Oh , that is good . 
Perhaps I can help you open your mouth . 
I tried to carry out his instructions the best way I know how . 
Oh , there were many , Excellency . 
Let me help you up . 
Blessed be the three Marias ! 
All right , Mr. Oh- So- Clever- One . 
What good would it do ? 
Yes , you are here at an opportune time . 
This is a fiesta . 
Your Excellency can see for himself . 
- He seemed very attracted to you . 
He sounds clever . 
A man who held a respected position in this community . 
It 's a pleasure to see you both again . 
Yes . 
I do not need your advice or help ! 
More intelligent . 
Now I am free to do as I wish . 
Zorro will come to his rescue . 
An excellent idea , Don Diego . 
Another excellent idea . 
A pretty little thing like that ? 
Yes . 
The accommodations are much better than at the barracks . 
And the good will rejoice at your smile 
By our hero so daring and strong 
I brought it back , thought it might help . 
I 'm sure it has a special meaning . 
- Make your peace . 
- Yes , I thought I 'd have to kiII you . 
- WeIl , that 's very considerate of you . 
Now , how can I be your friend ? 
- Thanks for your hospitality , sergeant . 
Yes , I know .

Did the servants get away safely , did he say ? 
Father , this may not be as bad as it sounds . 
Let 's Iet Don Diego help us . 
Yes , he is . 
What was that I was saying about peace and quiet ? 
I do hope he 's not iIl . 
Don Diego , welcome .

Please , Theresa , please . 
They 're not angry in Los Angeles . 
Yes .

You 've been too easy on these peons . 
We come as friends . 
And besides , you managed to get away safely . 
Ha , ha . 
Somebody help me ! 
You can help them run , but they won 't escape . 
- Good day . 
- Yes . 
I 'm not that stupid . 
Yes . 
Darling , you shouldn 't have seen Kimber . 
- On the other hand , if he 's bluffing ... 
Smiles . 
The doc and I run out to help them . 
Oh , he look happy . 
My dear Uncle Sid ! 
Very good . 
A friend ? 
She won 't even go to a show without me taking her . 
I 'm glad . 
I don 't want your cousin she should be like that too . 
Yes . 
First I was kinda glad Charlie brought him along . 
It 'll make it easier for all of us if he can pull it off . 
She won 't tell me anything . 
I won 't cuff you 
When you come out from jail , you 'll be promoted 
The most precious time in one 's life 
Handsome man , give me your phone 
One hand won 't make noise itself 
Thank you so much !

Our friend , the ex- king of Moravia , drove me home . 
The new chief of police is a good man that I trust . 
Now , don 't pull the grand duke with me . 
I left it out because there is nothing to say of perfection . 
I hope he gets his love back . 
What is that , my beloved ? 
Promising weather for the coronation , don 't you think ? 
Yes . 
Oh , cheer up , Fanny . 
Oh , isn 't this wonderful ? 
And I won 't know anyone . 
- Yes . 
Yes , sir , it is . 
You had better say all night . 
I mean , it will satisfy democratic opinion . 
Fathers should kiss their sons . 
Yes . 
- I wish mother comes . 
Dear Kamla , walk carefully lest your foot slips . 
- Yes . 
Without that , one can 't gain any knowledge . 
I won 't spare you ! 
I won 't give them ! 
I 'm not dead . 
Thank God nobody saw . 
lf you treat him like this , how will we survive ? 
- We eat thanks to him ! 
lf you must live , live on charity . 
Who holds the generous man 's hand will be happy . 
It 's easy to watch the fun . 
I won 't talk to you ! 
Who cares ? 
Brother is very smart . 
Nobody cares about me ! 
The teacherjust said he won 't marry Chandra to Birju . 
I 'd sent mother for your hand . 
I 've been through great difficulties to rear you .

I beg you for my honour . 
You cannot kill me . 
- I wish mother comes .

I promise all of you now he won 't do anything . 
I 've been through great difficulties to rear you . 
- Good God ! 
I beg you for my honor . 
You cannot kill me . 
Why did you break your engagement with Hiroko ? 
We hope that you will dissuade them . 
If the Mysterians gain ground on Earth , others will arrive . 
It looks like ... ... the Earth forces ! 
Do your best to finish the heat ray cannon in time . 
But we can 't save them now .

Go home and rest OK 
Yes , Frank 
If he 's still alive after 10 minutes it means he 's innocent 
Looks like you 're doing well

Splendid . 
Now clean them up . 
All the same , I 'd better go up there . 
They can 't win . 
I think I better escort you wherever you 're going . 
Self- denial , man 's only true joy .

Loyalty is always more passionate than reason . 
- And you making love ... 
Or do you like living like a pig ? 
Would you kiss me , Norman ? 
- Well , I 'll see you around , okay ? 
I had my love a long time ago . 
Thanks , Seth . 
I 'll come back tomorrow , when you 're feeling better . 
But I loved you from the moment you were born . 
I can 't get over how wonderful you look . 
Not a respectable person in town would accept him . 
Raise your hand . 
Loyalty is always more passionate than reason . 
- You and Rodney making love . 
Maybe yours was better . 
Would you kiss me , Norman ? 
I had my love a long time ago . 
- Don 't you go shoving a man with an ax in hand . 
I 'll come back tomorrow when you 're feeling better . 
[ Laughter ] 
It 's an escape , when the mind can 't accept what it sees . 
But I loved you from the moment you were born . 
For thine is the kingdom ... and the power and the glory forever . 
But you had the freedom to come and go ... and invite boys in ... 
All right , I won 't . 
Young , and with faith . 
It put iron in the country 's backbone , gave them brave memory . 
Yes , sir . 
But we are not going to die .

Yeah , but if I don 't get well , I might never see her again . 
Oh , dear God . 
It 's more like ...

Alive ! 
And you be a good boy . 
It has been proved effective against normal species . 
I am not stupid , Sermaine . 
I hope you will too . 
You 'd better tell him so . 
Good night . 
You 've always been so strong . 
Yes , that 's always an option ... 
We have pistols and hand grenades , versus tanks and airplanes . 
La Comparsita would be much better , or something like it . 
Oh , God , the acoustics are amazing ! 
You 're better off , Halinka .

Thank God , I never caught you in the act . 
Natale won 't give you a dime ! 
Please , dear , let me go ! 
It happens when you love each other . 
You love me , right ? 
And he thinks he 's brave . 
All right , mutual respect . 
With you it 's like walking into a bank to blow up the safe .

It was beautiful here . 
Things have been very lively in Paris . 
Thanks , Michel . 
Fascination ! 
It lacks any musical merit whatsoever . 
You need help . 
You 've been a wonderful father . 
Maybe that would have been a good idea , Monsieur . 
And when I see lovers , 
You 're free in the afternoon ? 
I should have kept my good memory of you . 
I 'm rich . 
She has to seem more generous than me . 
That 's true ! 
If I didn 't do it , it 's that I lacked the physical courage . 
The records will help a lot . 
It 's a safety valve . 
For me , love is an adventure . 
I 'm on holiday . 
We have a beautiful English governess who walks around nude . 
I 'll help you , if you want 
You come see me here , it 's much nicer .

Only I care . 
Who cares if I show my pants ? 
She was my first love . 
You see , my dear , music is a matter of taste ! 
Good morning . 
Do you really need a suit or it 's an excuse to be hugged ? 
Wasting our best years ! 
With two I am safer than just one . 
Easy . 
' Who dies lies and who lives gets peace ' , ok ? 
- Girls don 't know how to have fun . 
Hug this ! 
I don 't want a kiss from you . 
Kisses , I like to give and receive them . 
I am in love . 
Good morning 
You dad is more sentimental than you ! 
Tell your mum that this month ... ... I won 't pay the rent , eh ? 
Leonetto is very intelligent , for the record ! 
Can 't I take the mickey out of your friends ? 
Do it and you won 't see me again ! 
I love you ! 
Aren 't you happy with me ? 
Is this your love for me ? 
Great news ! 
It 's her only jewel ! 
- Who cares , I hit what I hit ! 
- Yes ! 
Oh , yes , yes , yes ! 
I 'm sleeping perfectly well , thank you . 
Splendid . 
Oh , good evening . 
Pleased you got the file .

- The Ministry will draw a neat double line . 
For heaven 's sake , forget these posters for just five seconds ! 
And the mark was on her hand . 
- Yes . 
- Nice and normal . 
Why don 't you give your father a hand ? 
- Father , we 'd better go . 
Yes . 
Yes , it would have to be , wouldn 't it , a made thing ? 
Here , are you OK , Mrs Mac ? 
Well , how do you like that ? 
They said good faith . 
Better make sure . 
Come down to clean the room . 
I 'm feeling like suffocating . 
I wish you long and good life . 
What a exciting scene . 
A beggar won 't owe the rent . 
With hopes . 
The Buddha will use a sincere eye to protect you . 
What good things have you done ? 
Sai is a good friend of mine , don 't disturb . 
You love her , and I 'll give her to you . 
You won 't do things so poorly . 
He says having a good heart means a lady . 
I know everything is true . 
There are so many happy persons . 
Promise him , he needs your support . 
I am OK , but we can 't forgive her . 
He 's free . 
Even you won 't believe it . 
All you said is of dreams , I am not . 
Feeling cool at the back . 
And then to share half the wealth with you . 
" It 's great if the sky drops some gold . "

- Darling . 
She won 't give me the time of day . 
We 'd make better rent from beggars . 
Money buys you Buddha 's mercy ! 
Let the heavens rain down coins ! 
I don 't care ! 
I had a fantastic memory . 
Why don 't you get some help ? 
Everything 'll be for the best . 
The Buddha will gaze at you , his eyes full of great mercy . 
Don 't make me laugh . 
You 'd have it that everywhere else is terrific . 
And who 's to say that the truth is always good ? 
I 'd better tell him . 
We can kiss that hacking good- bye . 
Plenty of folks around us live the good life . 
Actually , it makes them kind of sweet . 
The lessons are free , too . 
Say yes to him . 
This man will never abuse you . 
That was great . 
Everybody , help me . 
Happy now ? 
But that Gramps was awfully sweet . 
For free , too . 
She 's beyond help . 
You gotta hand it to her . 
I wish every last one of you were banished ! 
Money buys you Buddha 's mercy ! 
Let the heavens rain down coins !

Then I 'll trust my spear to conquer it and pass .

I saved the younger master to escape . 
Master , her honour tells you . 
The city needs such a great general like you . 
Just predict the result if you are great . 
Trust me .

If a friend is praised ... some trouble at school ... 
Parental love too is a primitive animal instinct 
Makes it more interesting 
You 've been very kind 
Anyway , try it , and I think you 'll succeed

" My Dear Lady . " Always " My Dear Lady . " 
A lovable man . 
But there is one more thing I 'd like to add . 
Ditto , my good buffoon , one of those nickel cigars . 
Oh , His Honor 's very particular when it comes to that . 
He may need the luck . 
Thanks for everything .

Our president , your husband , was so dynamic 
Vero ... we 're safe

He doesn 't dare be happy . 
If you were afraid , so much the better .

And your faithful old horse grazing at the grass by your side . 
Know what it 's really like ? 
I won it back . 
Good- looking boots . 
- Do these go on any special way ? 
- You gotta help . 
The fun 's in the picking , not the fighting . 
Starting a fight won 't help you get that girl back .

I 'm not a liar .

Hey lady , look at the pretty baby ! 
I 'm merely what the United Nations would call an observer . 
Then this young man was her friend ? 
My brother Vic 's as good as convicted . 
Without laying a hand on him . 
- Won 't you drive me ? 
Take it easy . 
Strange , I 've been told I have a very winning personality . 
In the old days , we never hurt people in the face . 
You don 't help yourself by treating this as a joke .

Now , surely philosophy can wait . 
But I love him . 
Yes . 
- Good night , darling . 
Yeah , well , like I say . 
Good evening . 
A life devoted to others . 
Dr. Stein says for you to make yourselves comfortable . 
- Yes . 
Are you quite sure you want to work here ? 
Congratulations . 
I will help you when you 're better . 
Sooner or later he 'll need my help . 
Yes , that 's what I said . 
I brought him here and operated in the hope of saving his life . 
Yeah , well , like I say .

- It ain 't that peaceful . 
Isn 't it easier for you with him changed and soft ? 
- Some say she 's prettier than you . 
I was glad , thinking , " Now I 'm free for once . " 
You needn 't laugh at Eben . 
He 's better than any of you . 
- Ain 't he a funny man ? 
You 're truly going to leave me on account of his being born ? 
You love him . 
I do love you . 
Yes . 
I loved Eben from the start . 
I got to thinking of you , of how much I loved you . 
I won 't let you . 
I can save him , perhaps . 
Sure and ready is my protection . 
He laughed at our questions ... 
Monster , do you laugh at this ghastly torment ? . 
And liberty returns . 
This trusted man of mine will see to it . 
Faster , don 't let them win 
Nothing , she loves watching the sunset 
You can 't go joy riding in my car 
Do I get special treatment because I 'm an orphan ? 
He should be happy , strange guy 
It 's how you treat her 
How can you treat me in this manner ? 
The water here is sweet now 
Listen , the boss cares about you so much 
Diamonds , elegant and graceful 
This is a nice one 
Why 'd someone be interested in a middle- aged lady ? 
I know , you better go 
Who will take care of him then ? 
I won 't . 
I can 't trust anyone now 
Thanks 
Help me ... 
Come back to me , pretty lady 
No matter what I dial , I get nothing but these idiotic sounds . 
I just thought it was pretty .

Better just carry on .

Don 't you care , Robert . 
Thank you again and good night .

We used to be such friends .

He loved his mother very much . 
Great , greatly . ' " 
- I 'd better start to study . 
You go ahead , see if I care . 
Sorry , it was a lovely interlude . 
Then I 'd feel better . 
After all you have good teeth 
Come ... show some sings of rejoicing ! 
As if one still eats like the young and hardy . 
Mata- yan , as a neigbor and old friend , 
Why not at least feed him at Festival time ? 
The quicker I go , the more the Gods will favor me . 
- Eat slowly .. and as much as you wish . 
Come , give a hint of pleasure , please . 
You won 't eat dinner with us tonight ! 
Hear , Matayan , as an old friend of mine ,

Good ! 
Give me your hand . 
Is that true ? 
Yes . 
Make it easy on yourself . 
We won 't allow anything to happen to him .

There wasn 't much joy in this house .

Laughing at what ? 
Or maybe he was Iaughing because he was happy . 
I 'm fond of him . 
Good Lord !

I trust they will let me pass . 
He was the one who asked , " What is progress ? " 
He was a good old man . 
Family is being set against family ... and friend against friend .

Good afternoon , madam . 
It 's a lovely city . 
I 'm not going to hurt her . 
Yes . 
I was , but I 'm better . 
Your parents didn 't take care of it . 
I 'm not dead yet . 
No but , I 'm not as stupid as I look . 
Looking for a good deed . 
When I get up I wish I didn 't have to think . 
Be a good friend , Francois and help me . 
He doesn 't love her . 
Nothing a little medecine won 't cure . 
It 's not disgusting . 
It 's not horrible . 
They don 't care about words . 
I 'm sure this one will be fine .

I will eat , laugh and sleep again . 
Then we 'd better listen to it . 
There 's maternity allowance and child benefit - 
We won 't do anything that you don 't agree to . 
Why did I joke and laugh so much ? 
Keep your hopes up for as long as you can . 
It won 't bulge . 
This is wonderful . 
It 's as if there 's nothing but death all around . 
A cool serenity , an inviolable security ? 
Don 't be funny 
- Good morning . 
We should appreciate it more 
They wouldn 't dare burn down a precious temple like Shukaku 
I 'm grateful that he 's well . 
- What lovely presents . 
One mustn 't make fun of alerts . 
We 're just a bit better off . 
- I 'll help . 
You 're so beautiful , I didn 't watch where I jumped ! 
Soenji 's success is due to you . 
For the cat would not be dead if Chao Chou had been there .

If I smile , I will smile with you , 
You are very proud of your love , isn 't it ? 
He has gone with his friends for a hunt . 
Yes . 
Hang me after that if you wish . 
Haven 't we had enough of two- bit prizes ? 
This OK ? 
- I didn 't think you cared . 
I want to help you . 
By finding truth and beauty where you 'd never expect to find it .

He 's an old friend of mine . 
It all seems so neatly planned . 
Yes . 
But it 's not suicide , either . 
So he threw himself in the lake of his own free will ? 
" What I love and cannot own , nobody else can touch . " 
- How can the dream solve the case ? 
He 's a nice man ... although a bit off his rocker ... 
We 're free today , it 's Saturday . 
Good morning , Elite ! 
A hand grenade or a shell .

- I 've got a pretty strong stomach . 
He thinks I expect him to be a hero . 
Thanks , Major .

I thought I 'd better bring Addie straight here . 
I 'm perfectly well . 
Now , please prepare a demonstration as soon as possible .

It 'll all be taken care of , nice and tidy .

What 's going on is you saved my life , man . 
Okay , look , the accepted vernacular is " gay , " but , yeah . 
Believe me , you 're better than that . 
Well , Bensley got five years and his gay friend got three . 
Good morning , Daddy . 
Just some regular gay folks having a party . 
Gay guys know how to dance good . 
You and Paula , the most beautiful couple I ever laid eyes on . 
I 'm trying to get Eric interested in baseball . 
I 'm great , I 'm great . 
These guys are good guys . 
Because I still love my wife . 
Help me ! 
I 'm just asking for one kiss , Councilman . 
Excuse me , gentlemen , but to whom have I the honour ... ? 
It means we trust you less and less . 
How nice is your little wife . 
They’ re just waiting for an opportunity . 
Your friend Géo is a man . 
And that someone would be Casa’ s friend ? 
Why should I care about all this ? 
You know perfectly well what I’ m talking about . 
After a good night , he’ il be as good as new . 
Can I make it better ? 
- Yes , they are . 
And let me tell you that this one attracts flies . 
I thought you were more ... more subtle , my dear director . 
Yes indeed .

You will be better off by taking a son- in- law to help you . 
She makes fun of me . 
The good ones slept here . 
All of this just to have free movies . 
He had a tough dad , he has a strong wife . 
Yes , it is .

You did well convincing him .

Can 't do better . 
I 'd love to know what your " witness " had to say . 
- Even better reason not to wear a sign . 
That 's why , my dears , you still have the option of bowing out . 
My dears , this is no joke . 
More like scum . 
- Oh , yes . 
- " My husband didn 't succeed him , etc . " 
- Wow . 
I had gone out with friends . 
With your rap sheet , you might just get time if you 're lucky . 
Yes ... 
Ok , ok . 
It 's not just for revenge against Yvonne . 
Hey , when you 've got talent ... 
And jurors won 't forgive that . 
Promise yourselves that your sheep won 't corrupt water ? 
Mr. Sweet ! 
Would try yourselves to win of the time not to dance with me ? 
This man enjoys here ! 
Pretty , aren 't they ? 
I grew older and became a rich man , which was sensible of me . 
- Still , I wish you were free . 
' cause he would 've enjoyed Yonkers . 
We think she 's wonderful , don 't we , Barnaby ? 
Maybe we 'd better run away now . 
We don 't want the second best , 
- Well , thank you , ma 'am . 
May I hope we shall meet again ? 
France has so much to commend her . 
It was said laughingly to beguile the time . 
It 's the wisest thing to expect , and the likeliest . 
I love you . 
Not worthy of such feeling . 
Leaving the heavens to awake us . 
Just heaven ! 
It 's true , friends . 
Oh , don 't heed it , my precious . 
Oh , may heaven forgive me . 
Thank God her relationship is by marriage . 
It depends upon you , and you entirely , to save her . 
And so , please God , will they . 
The law of the strongest , sir . 
Any luck ? 
But our luck held out . 
The people of which you speak , saved me when our vessel sank . 
We must prepare immediately , your Excellence . 
If you have courage , I know how we can do it .

Our lucks out ! 
Ready for action , sir ! 
- Have you sent for the bomb ? 
- Easy to judge others 
So that you could start living in peace . 
My dear God ... 
- Jesus ' holy name be praised . 
Yes , yes ... 
- Yes . 
I only care for you to get the diploma . 
You 'll make corrections in your CV , yes ? 
- You 've saved me . 
Yes ?

You look good up there , Link . 
Yes ! 
They 'll probably give you a medal .

You aren 't certain about my love for you ? 
Yes . 
Please help me , swordsman . 
So you 're well prepared .

I did this for his own good . 
She completely charmed you .

- Yes .

We 're nearly there , my darling . 
And with God 's help we 'll succeed . 
- Yes .

- I am interested in life . 
I am interested in scientific living things . 
We also need economic intelligence . 
Oh , definitely , sir . 
- Good night , Father . 
- Yes . 
I 'll take care of that in the morning . 
This will be better . 
I was just getting fond of him . 
I wonder why they let you and me get back here safely . 
- We 'd better get to the others . 
She has many friends in the police department . 
One never tortures except by mutual agreement . 
- I suppose I 'd better not go . 
- It 's as strong as another man 's . 
- Yes .

But happiness comes only through marriage 
Neither of us had the courage to face up to it 
You mustn 't let happiness ... 
I won 't allow such methods ! 
Beating them won 't help 
Go if you wish ! 
You 're quite a bold one ! 
Kaji ... how about those special laborers ? 
Make sure they 're not feigning illness 
Why try to be a hero ? 
I won 't let them do it ! 
I didn 't come of my own free will ! 
Look ... isn 't it wonderful ? 
Man can become as strong as he wishes 
You can 't expect any sympathy from me ! 
You still wish to buy some of it ? 
Do you need my help ? 
Can they really be saved ? 
All they can hope for is their love 
For one who plans great things you 've a small mind ! 
I have tried to protect your interests . 
Let me speak for my friend , Kaji . 
Admit that you 'd let them escape ... if you could ! 
She 's in bed with the cute one . 
Chen won 't help any more . 
Was it good ? 
Let us take care of this Korean dog ! 
I won 't tell the boss . 
On behalf of the men in the pit and for the sake of friendship , 
No ... that won 't do ! 
I won 't let him escape alone ! 
We 'll report you as having been shot helping the men to escape . 
I won 't do an hing , 
I 'll call for help ! 
Relax and try again . 
Pvt. Tanaka ... you should show our guest more courtesy . 
After all ... he was your friend ! 
Good men are scarce since Wang Heng Li escaped . 
But happiness comes only through marriage . 
Going to remain just friends forever ? 
Neither of us had the courage to face up to it . 
You mustn 't let happiness ... 
I won 't allow such methods ! 
Beating them senseless won 't help . 
Go if you wish ! 
Take good care of her . 
You 're quite a bold one ! 
Help me ! 
Master ... when we be free ? 
Kaji ... how about those special labourers ? 
Make sure they 're not feigning illness . 
Why try to be a hero ? 
I won 't let them do it ! 
I didn 't come of my own free will ! 
Look ... isn 't it wonderful ?

For one who plans great things you 've a small mind ! 
I have tried to protect your interests . 
Let me speak for my friend , Kaji . 
Yes . 
With things going smoothly , Kaji has relaxed his guard . 
She 's in bed with the cute one . 
Chen won 't help any more . 
Was it good ?

Good men are scarce since Wang Heng Li escaped . 
But happiness only lies in marrying the one you love . 
I 'm a born optimist . 
Are you going to be platonic friends forever ? 
If you let happiness slip through your fingers ... 
Trick me into giving you special rations ? 
Any good ideas ? 
Take good care of her . 
The Japanese won 't keep us supplied . 
Kaji , why are so many special laborers left in camp ? 
Why play the hero ? 
I won 't allow it . 
Welcome home ! 
Why won 't you tell me about it ? 
It was nice talking to you . 
Man can become as strong as he wishes . 
Want to make some easy money ? 
Can they really be saved ? 
They have their love today . 
It won 't be much longer . 
Wang , the safety of your men depends on all of you . 
That won 't be necessary . 
It may take time ... but I hope you 'll trust me and be patient . 
Let me speak for my friend Kaji . 
She 's in bed with the cute boy . 
Chen won 't help anymore . 
I won 't talk . 
I won 't tell the boss . 
Tops in Japan ! 
I won 't let him escape alone ! 
We 'll report that we caught you helping the men escape . 
- You 're wronging the innocent ! 
I won 't do anything . 
I 'll be happy to oblige . 
Pvt. Tanaka ... you should show our guest more courtesy . 
I made him a happy man . 
He won 't listen to me . 
Why is it I feel like laughing ? 
Yes , they 're sensitive to questions . 
- I won 't say a word . 
Good heavens , no ! 
I 'm so relieved . 
It was more fun . 
Sometimes the truth does taste like worms .

I 'd be honored if you 'd write to me at the military academy . 
You are nothing more than a miserable , clumsy little farmer . 
George wrote that you might be interested in seeing the foundry . 
Yet a great general like Napoleon did that , Mr. Main . 
like your friends , Mr. Main and Mr. Hazard ? 
Please , we mustn 't say things like that to each other . 
Because he favored negotiating with Mexico ? 
There 's only one way to redeem our honor . 
He won 't see us . 
I would not punish an animal that way and neither would you ! 
If you ever cross me or my friend Orry Main again ... 
I hope it 's not inconvenient . 
For the true crop of a Southern plantation ... is a human crop . 
I won 't do it . 
As if you didn 't have confidence in my ability . 
You can tell your friends they needn 't leave . 
You can just lie there and rot , for all I care . 
One moment , sweet Ashton . 
He won 't . 
And I see him as a man who deserves to be free ! 
I demand satisfaction ! 
Yes , sir . 
Ready , two ! 
If you 're as good as you taste ... 
I 've been having dreams about my father . 
She ain 't done nothing wrong ! 
I will give him credit for his past heroism . 
She was very special to me . 
A sorry ending to the woman who inspired that beautiful painting . 
- He 's nothing but a murderer . 
But you and your kind are finished . 
And surely you can guess who issued those orders , Mr. Main . 
I love you ! 
He 's not dead . 
But this time , it 's true ? 
Somebody who doesn 't care ! 
This is what Secession really means , my friends . 
God , I 'm glad you came . 
- You make the most beautiful bride . 
Help him . 
- I declare , sweet . 
Thanks to your scheming . 
You and that Yankee scum you call your friends ! 
You 'll be better here . 
Jefferson Davis is his only equal in that respect . 
I wonder how wise I am to travel South with you . 
Justice will be done ! 
Orry 's our friend , he had a right to feel safe in this house . 
All you big , strong men are alike . 
Maybe the cook over at the lunchroom isn 't sympathetic enough . 
- He has a special faculty for that . 
It 's good . 
Good , we say that I am an optimist . 
Good , it was it . 
Attempt to remove the best party to him . 
- Yes . 
- Yes ? 
Good , what is what it happens to him ? 
- They clear the cover ! 
- Yes , I know already it .

Look , if you 're so smart , you do it yourself . 
But I 'll take anything if it 'll help me with the way I feel . 
And yet , all he 'd be able to honestly say is " I 'm sorry . " 
Like I said , Bennie , nothing you 'd be interested in . 
This is a party !

Looked good to me . 
Where 's the party ? 
Congratulations . 
" Congratu- fucking- lations . " Round one ... ... you win . 
Enjoy . 
Let 's go to the other room and I 'll take care of your hands . 
Why doesn 't one of us call out for help ? 
You 've had your fun . 
- You 're pretty handy yourself . 
Okay , you win . 
She was cute too . 
This is , plain and simple , good old- fashioned homicide . 
Good point . 
Lovely . 
Happy birthday , baby ! 
I apologize for my wife , we will be united later . 
Care ! 
In that moment he doesn 't care anything . 
I won 't stay here ! 
Good night . 
Are all of agreement ? 
They won 't serve us as anything . 
- How are you so sure ? 
We already almost finish affection . 
To a new victory won by the Prince of Israel . 
- Yes , take up arms against him . 
- It is said that Solomon is wise . 
Who would dare to murmur against the great Solomon ? 
We come in memory of the love my daughter Abishag gave to you . 
Who will save us now from Pharaoh ? 
The Egyptians have overthrown our noble Solomon . 
To a new victory won by the Prince of Israel .

So I kissed a girl . 
He 's a funny kid , though , you know .

Dissolved my hand and my foot with fly vomit . 
Where 's your compassion ? 
I 'm getting better . 
Great , just fucking great . 
I almost wish it didn 't have to end like this . 
Yes , I think so . 
- Yes , Philippe , I remember that . 
Threw sand in this lovely creature 's face ?

I love you . 
Your macho friend Donovan , you and he are ... 
Friends , like we were ? 
It would spoil all my fun . 
Until you arrived , this was a nice , quiet research facility . 
Unlike you , my job is to save lives , not to take them . 
It 's all I can do to keep my courage up right now . 
You 're the only living creature in the universe that I love . 
- Yes , sir . 
She has to be handled with care

If that 's not a worst- case scenario , it 'll do for one . 
' Not at all ' , he said . ' It was exhilarating . ' 
I did not kill that woman . 
There should have been blood hand- prints all over . 
Good ! 
But it sounds to me like you 've been given a gift . 
We can do better than that . 
Yeah , you have a really strong face . 
Help !

And you claim you love your mother ! 
She was perfect . 
Yes , many .

You weren 't proud to be you , just to be yourself . 
A nice business merger between the two families . 
Are you happy now , you swine !

Your Honour , there is nothing new in this case . 
But this is a special case . 
Dear , dear , dear ... 
Yeah , I couldn 't have wished for anything better . 
Aye , and you 'd better look out for yourself . 
Still , it 's nice to stay at home and entertain your friends . 
That may be wise .

Three witnesses , gallant gypsies , discovered her in a forest .

Won 't even try . 
It won 't be long now .

He was a real nice guy . 
Why don 't you trust scientists ? 
The doctor told you to take it easy ! 
It 's just to amuse the kids . 
- Won 't make it through the night . 
I 'm sure you also experienced a sort of elation . 
- Thanks . 
Getting my arm bandaged , I hope .

All I can do is my best . 
Hey , Bat , you are in about the best place to get stampeded .

Please forgive me . 
Trust you to think of that one . 
I 'm surprised you 're a sentimentalist . 
They 're my friends , I told you . 
I 'm not angry . 
Yes , His Highness . 
- Yes . 
- Help Kumar . 
Mr Bridie will have to take care . 
Well , we 'd better try and find a home for young India . 
I 've composed a superb tune . 
I mean , make the character a little more glamourous . 
Look , Suresh , only good things are mentioned in this house . 
It ' II be good if you forgive me . 
It won 't straighten for 10 days ! 
" Nine looked lovingly " 
You were successful , but not anymore ! 
The bazaar of wealth functions in this manner . 
The heroine of the film you direct ... ... will be Shantidevi . 
I will certainly not let you drink !

I won 't tell him you were here . 
He still would be champion if he hadn 't been robbed . 
We better get over there . 
You ain 't fit to live ! 
( laughing ) 
I hope you boys remember that . 
That ain 't very funny . 
Yes , sir . 
Now make your play face- to- face if you got the guts for it ! 
I think I 'd better get you inside . 
She 's such a pretty little thing . 
( laughs ) 
I think she just liked the idea of being married to a Cartwright . 
I 've got some good ideas about it . 
Thought it was good enough to work a little blackmail . 
Little slimming here and there , I 'll be as good as new . 
( laughs ) 
I won 't ask for any more . 
I 'll take good care of the boy . 
I never figured to kill Sue Ellen . 
You know , it 's kinda sweet , you know ? 
I think we better ... 
I guess we better show him , Hoss , eh ? 
I 'll take care of Hoss . 
I can take care of them señoritas . 
We 're friends . 
When will Your Honor reveal herself to the North Americans ? 
But I will save your life . 
I guess you just couldn 't help it . 
( all laughing ) 
Yes . 
( laughs ) 
" Kiss her until she be wearied out 
You loved her , didn 't you ? 
Well , maybe you will , maybe you won 't . 
Oh , I guess it 's a nice day . 
If you want a chance to make your peace , throw out your guns ! 
Yep , even the kids are thinking like that . 
Well , yes , ma 'am , and that , seems to me 
And it was such a nice day for it , too . 
Yes , sir . 
All same much happy see friend . 
Well , if honorable father just take my horse to the stable , 
That isn 't true . 
( yelling in Chinese ) ( laughing ) 
I liked Sally . 
Sheriff Halstead 's a fair and honest man . 
Yes , and our city 's overrun with these undesirables . 
You got lots of friends in this town . 
Yes , she did . 
You satisfied ? 
But this room is much better than you 're used to , my dear . 
What would we gain ? 
That 's a very good way of putting it . 
Well , if it ain 't the great lady 's knight in shining armor . 
He can 't help us . 
Everyone loves the rich , hmm ? 
Adam , I wish some of that would rub off on you . 
They 're the same kind as tried to string you up . 
All right , now , clear out ! 
Jeb saved my life . 
I thought it just to save me . 
Well , that wouldn 't help matters . 
I don 't care to see any man in chains . 
Good night . 
Good night , Dave . 
He was trying to help Walker escape . 
Are you satisfied ? 
And to such a nice fella , too . 
All right , take it easy , boy . 
( gentle classical music playing ) ( chuckles ) Oh , Ben . 
Well , the Ponderosa demands a great deal of work . 
Well , maybe that 'll be the best part . 
And it won 't help her . 
Thanks , Ben . 
Well , I 'm gonna give you a chance to do just that . 
Yes , I 've already told you . 
Good night . 
We have a pretty big piece of land here . 
Yes , sir . 
I guess you didn 't listen good when I told you about her . 
He needs care . 
That 's something I care about very much . 
Yes , I saw the scars they got in the stockade . 
Paul , I love you . 
You 'd better get started back to the Fort , Corporal . 
Yeah , well , Hawkins better keep his men out of my way . 
Yes 'm . 
Better get on with your talking . 
Yes , sir . 
Well , I hope you get that petition signed . 
You better be right . 
Your husband 's a friend of my father 's . 
He 's probably feeling pretty good since he 's shown who 's boss . 
You and Hamp both deserve a bonus . 
They ain 't gonna turn down free oysters and champagne , 
Yes , I can imagine . 
He can take care of himself . 
Believe me , it 's best . 
Well , now why don 't you try to calm yourself down . 
( laughing ) 
Yes . 
He 's in love . 
Tod 's got a great deal of respect for your opinion . 
I 'm glad you 're still here . 
I 'm glad you feel that way . 
It isn 't just a lover 's quarrel . 
Who 's to say what 's healthy and what 's not ? 
Well , then we better make 'em stop and think . 
For our friendship , would you drive them off the Ponderosa ? 
We take care of ourselves . 
Oh , come now , friend . 
Don 't be funny . 
Yeah , it sure is . 
( Glory shrieks ) 
And that 's better than never finding it at all , isn 't it ? 
Yep , sure is . 
Yes , sir . 
Your pa 's nothing but a dirty ol ' convict . 
It 's all right , Mr. Sherman , I 'll take care of it . 
Yes , sir . 
But nobody cared , so that 's where they sent me . 
You said you were my friend . 
I hope he does ! 
I may go anywhere I want to go , and be whatever I wish to be . 
My son can take pretty good care of himself in that department . 
Help me . 
I don 't care . 
They will take him away and make my soul as clean as air . 
I 'll take care of this , Cartwright . 
Do you measure emotions by the clock , Your Honor ? 
( laughter ) ( gavel pounding ) 
Won 't we ever have a decent town to live in ? 
I figure he 'll be smart enough to back down . 
( laughter ) 
These fir branches will make a good bed for you , ma 'am . 
What you need is a little loving to cheer you up . 
I know that , but I want to take care of you . 
Mr. Pennington here saved my life . 
( laughter ) 
He 's a good soldier , at least he used to be . 
Ben , Ben Cartwright knows Indians better than any man in Nevada . 
Even your friend , 
What 'd you expect , a welcome mat ? 
I ride for peace , oh , Chief of the Paiutes . 
The Paiute wants peace . 
Winnemucca , we 're friends . 
They want to read something that will make them laugh . 
Couldn 't we , uh , settle this a little more peaceably ? 
You know , I think I 'd better see what I can do about this . 
My husband always wins . 
You 'd better have a good story this time , Mister . 
My friends , I believe in fair play . 
And a little bit smarter . 
If only I didn 't love you so . 
As a matter of fact , I 'm proud of him . 
Ah , Adam , you 're a good , kind man . 
( laughter ) Yeah ! 
Annie , you 've done good . 
I 'll take care of everything , for old time 's sake . 
Pat , oh , thank God you 're here . 
Well , I 'd be honored , Mr. Diedeshiemer . 
I 'd tell him to take care of his own work . 
Young man , pass that plate of sweet corn , please . 
Now , if you filed this claim in a legal- like courthouse ... 
Bartender , pour the little lady a drink of your best whiskey . 
I never stop worrying since I met you . 
- Yes , Sergeant Major . 
Well , glad to see you 've got the violin . 
Surely , you are joking . 
- But if she loves ... 
- Yes . 
Cheer up . 
Yes , and we ... we carry on as planned . 
Daddy , for heaven 's sake ! 
- Thank you , Your Honour , but ... 
- Yes , I know . 
I loved her . 
He really thought I 'd left him for good , didn 't you , dear ?

Yes , let 's hope it 'll never be used . 
- What kind ? 
- Yes . 
Mr. Grand Marshal , permit me to dismantle it first . 
We won ! 
- He won 't let you dismantle it ? 
He knows whoever has the bomb has the world by the tail . 
Yeah , sure , they just about control the world . 
It belongs to the United States . 
You won 't get away with it .

I want to play under the rain . 
Come in , there are only friends here . 
You 're not that bad after all .

[ PLAYS WlTH VlGOR ] 
Or don 't you even care anymore ? 
- Yes , I know , Sir . 
He was one of our best men . 
I 've come here to put in ... a good word for the Iad . 
I 'm afraid this man won 't be able to confess now . 
How sweet . 
You must trust me . 
Yes , I 'II see . 
Because his sister didn 't want to save him ! 
Yes , what is it ? 
You didn 't succeed after aIl . 
- Remarkable how few people do realize ... 
Good trip ? 
Tommy Sweet is real country ? 
- That is good right ? 
You write the most beautiful I want some of ... 
- This will be your best years of the last seven . 
That was great ! 
- Yes . 
Take it easy . 
But I will help you with it . 
That is not the way to love Him , 
We must love Him , 
The faithful no longer appreciate this type of sermon . 
It 's easy for you to say !

Yes . 
You 'd better look for something else . 
- What are these dreams ? 
I can 't help it . 
Warsaw is happy . 
I 'm with the Revolution , but not for killing . 
- Yes ! 
You 'd better find him soon ! 
Hand it out . 
With all respect , Colonel , I 'll take care of your reaction . 
You 've given me a good lesson , Colonel ! 
You won 't ever get me to like you . 
He could have given a great service . 
Why do you care about me ? 
And I find her ... ... engaged with another man ! 
The truth is that this colonel seems to be ... ... very brave . 
Yes . 
I love you . 
I like you and you like me . 
Your hand in my hair . 
I don 't like the " Zeta " nor you ! 
Sweet things , kisses ... 
- You look like a clown ! 
- Thanks . 
- Now I feel much better . 
Well that 's what it felt like . 
Help ! 
That 's it , good man ! 
I have the impression that he 's a good guy , after all . 
Who cares about those guys . 
White was my son 's favorite color . 
Yes , last July , in Europe . 
Forgive me if I sound quite mad , but it 's true all the same . 
Doctor , can you help her ?

Was it true ? 
Yes .

Loved Sebastian from the beginning and nobody else . 
Yes .

And this you won 't believe . 
It 's too much for both of us , my darling . 
Yes , last July , in Europe . 
Forgive me if I sound quite mad , but it 's true all the same . 
- Can you help her ? 
I molested an elderly gardener of great virtue . 
Was it true ? 
Yes . 
Do you need help ? 
Loved Sebastian and nobody else . 
Yes . 
Since I 've been allowed to smoke , I 've become a perfect lamb . 
- She doesn 't trust me with the money ? 
- Yes ! 
- You know better than that .

Go by , go by , here the road is good . 
So good it tasted as if today I would not have a bite to eat . 
And yet , if it is true what I say 
Miracle ! 
Ok , you 're right you too have had a hand in the business . 
Boy , thanks , mister . 
Great . 
Yes . 
Boy , thanks , mister .

Great . 
Yes . 
Thanks a lot . 
They don 't care for their fathers even . 
" And yes , write to me as soon as you reach . " 
Shall I give you some good news ? 
" Are you the flower of my love , or my mistake ? 
Take care of him . " 
Will he bring good name to me ? 
Love is a lie ! 
- Yes . " 
I will take care of him . 
I don 't care for any sir . 
I won 't let you sell these books . " 
I am not a thief . 
I can assure you that my son is not a thief .

I won the battle and I 'm not fighting it again here and now . 
Agnes , this should be a joyous day . 
- No , I love you . 
And he prayed that my soul be saved . 
I find the defence has good reason to be concerned . 
It 's easy to mock faith . 
Do you wish the court to adjourn ? 
But among free people my point has a right to live . 
- Our Heavenly Father will decide . 
Take it easy . 
You admire him and love him just like I love him . 
Give her peace and quiet . 
You 're allowed to feel happy . 
She can live for her faith if she 's allowed to keep it . 
The blonde girl , the very pretty one . 
It would give me great pleasure to buy you something . 
Yes , I love you , Jerry . 
He could be taking it easy now , at his age . 
All they want is peace , comfort , security . 
Heartache , passion , a woman . 
Better get to bed . 
Yes , that 's right . 
Yes . 
We better get him over to my office . 
But suppose the legend is true ? 
Mashed hand . 
But I do know that our greatest advantage is our brains . 
I better get out there . 
Good , you brought some extra rope . 
- Yes , and it 's usually in his head . 
Even if I said yes , you couldn 't do it . 
You were looking for praise and for gain . 
Franz Lerner is one of the great guides of Switzerland . 
He won 't come , anyway . 
I 'm much better . 
You 're not angry ? 
- Well , I 'm dream walking . 
You ought to be glad of it . 
Keep a good watch on him . 
- It is true . 
Any luck in there ? 
Love speaks any language . 
He 'll won 't let us have it till we move . 
Please , not shoot ! 
Hakimbo , you can save these people . 
Then have him buried and see they make good job of it . 
- Perhaps he feels better . 
- You have a strong point there . 
That isn 't true , Max . 
Your grateful country will reward you with a stinking pension ! 
Ha- ha ( ! ) Some gold paint peeling off the road of honour , eh ? 
For thine is the kingdom , the power and the glory . 
There 's a lot in your report , my friend . 
I hope you 're fast learners . 
It 's magnificent ... 
You 're right , you can 't trust them . 
It was all true . 
Sure , I agree . 
This is a personal success . 
Yes 
Yes 
Won 't you make friends with me ? 
Grandpa won 't know , I won 't tell him 
Yes

The silver moon is rising , the beautiful moon . 
Thanks for everything .

There won 't be any marriage ! 
She 's in love !

Wish this can help you 
He 's great

I 'd like you to meet a friend of mine ... 
You better stay here . 
It 's OK , Mrs. Hutchins . 
Craig , you better keep an eye out for your dad . 
What 'd you have to help Craig with ? 
Craig ... I love you . 
Well , somebody 's gonna win . 
Peace ! 
Thanks for the encouragement , bro . 
Is that better ? 
Do me a favor , kid . 
And I certainly won 't be the last . 
Help ... please . 
Go give Mommy some love . 
Perfection . 
Best pizza in the neighborhood . 
Anything 's better than working for Rigo . 
They won 't find one . 
The breeze will sting and a passion I own 365 will equal 360 
Eric , you 're gonna be OK . 
It 's nice to see you , too , Gordo . 
I 'm a romantic , is what I am .

- Dude , you are so trippin ' -- - OK . 
Your dad doesn 't want hospice care . 
I don 't care ! 
I love my bike . 
But I love the food . 
This was your chance to be free ... to live in innocence again . 
We were celebrating . 
Yes ... I remember . 
I rea -- I really like Nancy . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , well , my supervisor says ... 
Look , you 're not gonna die , all right ? 
But with a little help from his family and friends ... 
It 's actually very funny . 
But listen , man , holler at me later , OK ? 
Well , you better believe it . 
That 's OK , man . 
Marvin , are you OK ? 
Give me my kiss . 
But your eyes say , " Yes , yes , yes . " 
I got a feeling my luck 's gonna change . 
I 'm good for it . 
Must be my turn to dance with Lady Luck , huh ? 
Just wish my dad could see me now . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , well , cops are edgy right now because -- 
But Romeo was his friend , right ? 
You 're a smart kid . 
Sweetie , don 't say that . 
I don 't care . 
Oh , that is so true . 
It 's true . 
Maybe someone should go and see if they 're OK . 
Bit right through my hand . 
I 'm hoping ... you 'll tell me it 's all in my mind . 
Thankfully , it hit a rural area . 
It is not a disaster . 
You 'll win . 
Yeah , OK . 
' Cause I want to play with you ... and not with her . 
That must make it hard ... when you have friends over to play . 
I take really good care of the girls . 
I have to take care of them . 
It 's OK . 
Help me . 
It 'd be nicer if we were all friends . 
You don 't see any of our old friends anymore . 
I won 't go back . 
I 'm not trying to ruin anything . 
Yes ! 
Anyway , you did love to watch me play . 
So ... who is the real hero of this story ? 
It 's safe to turn around now . 
And this didn 't help . 
Care for a drink ? 
Yeah , looks like we all run out of luck in the end . 
She asked me a very interesting question . 
Yes . 
Like I said , no good deed goes unpunished . 
But I saved your life . 
That 's good enough for me . 
Maybe this would help . 
Everything OK over there ? 
That 's very funny , Gloria . 
I know better , too . 
Better get up here . 
Catherine and I had fallen in love . 
I did him a favor . 
Good luck , hotshot . 
One hand for everything that we own . 
i wish i could make it more , i really do . 
It 's a mausoleum , a burial ground for ... for people 's hopes . 
This is honest money . 
If you 're happy , see a doctor . 
I 've protected you against disease . 
Jana , we 've loved you very much . 
No love . 
Well , she 's the best- looking ghost i ever saw , mr . 
That 's nice , huh ? 
I guess that 's pretty vital . 
What 's your pleasure , sir ? 
Well , whoever owns it has to tell the truth . 
Easy , mister . 
Just help me up . 
Isn 't it always the most trusted employee ? 
Yes , mr .

Are you out of your mi ... okay , jimbo , okay . 
I wish you could go with grandma , billy . 
Bayles , honest . 
Mr. Bayles ... i think you 'd better have a talk with your boy . 
I hope you 're fully aware of that . 
I 'm sure much of it is true . 
Oh , god , please , please , please ... tell them , mr . 
Dreams ! 
He 's ... yes , this is henry ritchie . 
How about a nice little electrical storm ? 
Kindly deposit ten cents please or shall i call the police .

I 'm the best pool cue on randolph street . 
It 's interesting to see how much faith you have in yourself . 
You never make the grade at anything by playing it safe . 
That was great . 
" the unbeatable champ of all times ! " 
It 's a win- at- any- price affair . 
You 're too good . 
They were our friends , weren 't they ? 
Let them raise an army like i did ! 
Well , well . 
He likes you . 
I ... hope it cools off by tonight . 
In my case , you succeeded . 
Honest . 
I hope you 're around to take a look at it . 
I can 't help it ! 
I hope you 'll be with us next week for " nothing in the dark . " 
Help . 
He seemed a nice young man . 
Easy , lady . 
Trust me . 
Well , yes , yes , indeed . 
I thought you were a great man . 
Congratulations , my dear . 
I 'm not fooling with it , my dear . 
I , uh , i think we 'd better go . 
You know me better than that . 
Many are now being saved . 
In a way , yes . 
I won 't . 
Keep america clean and beautiful . 
Oh , yes , i made a study of it . 
Yes , i 'll bet . 
They don 't like to be woken up late at night , i can assure you . 
I think you need some help . 
But i promise you i won 't stay . 
Yes , very brave . 
You are a brave man , officer sanchez . 
I come in peace . 
The cure - a little more faith . 
It 's a small house , but a happy one . 
Good- bye , children . 
Yes . 
Do me a favor , would you ? 
Lovely party , darling . 
He 's really quite happy now . 
Redfield , you stumbled upon the best- kept secret in the world . 
Unlike your world , we live in peace . 
Well , don 't you like the house ? 
Good- bye , mr . 
Yes ! 
Mister , i 'm just glad you 're alive . 
I 'm not running this place for pleasure . 
Used to be ... used to be people would laugh at him . 
Yes , tonight . 
All steel ... all strength . 
Oh , yes , you do . 
I set you free from any promise , billy . 
There , now you can get out of it and hand it to me . 
I 'm not hurt . 
Good . 
Thanks . 
Jackie ... the best boss a man could work for . 
Gives you a funny feeling , doesn 't it ? 
Yes , isn 't it ? 
One is , that you won 't have to spill any . 
Yes , so it says . 
Be brave , boy , be brave . 
You got a lot of phony charities come buggin ' you . 
You see , in the years , i am a child , but i think i am mature . 
What about this wealth bit ? 
But every bit as generous . 
Yes , sir . 
It would ... it would be like losing five close friends . 
But i am not an idiot , mr . 
The eyes lighting up - that 's the beauty part ! 
I had the greatest times . 
Len ... help me get him to a doctor tomorrow . 
Will you , for heaven 's sakes ? 
Yes , sir . 
And when that ship does arrive ... it won 't find a society . 
Would you do me a small favor , captain ? 
Just as you have survived . 
And the food - you won 't be able to eat it . 
But do you think i enjoy working 28 hours a day ? 
Now , now , easy , burgess . 
I await your pleasure . 
It is true , of course . 
It 's easy for you to say . 
It 's all right now , darling . 
Good morning , wage slaves . 
I won 't come here anymore . 
Yes ... you runt ! 
Have a good rest , mr . 
Thanks , mr .

Clocks are made by men , god creates time . 
But i 'm not sick . 
I wish i knew . 
A lot of your friends won 't get to see you . 
I was only trying to help you . 
And you want leah to marry somebody like you , huh ? 
Liking sports , buying new clothes ? 
Won 't you understand ? 
It 's been very nice talking to you , valerie . 
I mean , surely you 've had other fathers . 
I don 't see how anyone as nice as you has survived this long . 
I 'll take you someplace where you 'll be safe . 
We should save these creatures , not exterminate them . 
We 'll take good care of him . 
Yes . 
That sounds lovely . 
Wally will help you in the morning . 
Yes , sir . 
Okay , okay , i 'll call him right away ! 
Ha ! 
Ha ! 
I quite agree , father . 
Because none of you respond to love . 
Good . 
Nothing but peace . 
When he came at you , jagger ... did it feel good to you then ? 
Your luck is bound to get better . 
Yes , i believe it , boris . 
Gently , gently , major . 
You certainly have a good one . 
Now take it easy . 
Why do you want to ask a question like that for ? 
Oh , thank you , thank you . 
How very enlightening . 
And you 'd love only me ? 
Yes , i want to stay with you . 
Good- bye , love .

What , please , would you consider a compliment ? ! 
Not you , sweetheart . 
# Though your face is charming 
# Though your smile is lovely 
That 's called giving up , and you love her too much for that . 
Have some more courage . 
And I will go to the guillotine a happy woman . 
Who cares . 
Good .

We were so relieved ... 
You young punks have to learn to respect a man like me ! 
Do me this favor .

See how he loves you ? 
You even had the heavy hand . 
Talking like he 's the top of the heap in Japan today . 
It 's better for you that way . 
He 's not so bad . 
Our freedom today was bought with money ! 
You talk like that 's my only pleasure . 
Why do you take such an interest in me ? 
You thought that would make me happy ? 
Just relax .

Now , be a good girl and take your guardian and go home . 
What good would that do ? 
I 've come to help ... 
Enjoy the night while you can . 
Enjoy it well , both of you . 
There won 't be any going back . 
She 'd like you to excuse her . 
Yes . 
Joe , I guess we 'd better exercise that search warrant . 
Well , I 'm surprised , naturally . 
Yes , yes . 
- Yes , yes . 
Please , have mercy . 
- Very true . 
Better stay clear of them . 
But taxes eat up our wealth , so ... 
I granted him a favour . 
When a strong voice 
Now that he knows , you won 't surprise him a second time . 
- Yeah , it 's true . 
Good words . 
But I cannot make a plan based on third- hand rumours . 
A true gentleman , Seguin . 
- I bid you good night , ma 'am . 
It 's good we 're all here , gentlemen . 
You are sending me to safety . 
Just look at that great knife fighter yapping at Crockett . 
They won 't be here for four or five days . 
Well , I guess we 'd better do somethin ' about that , Crockett . 
Yes , sir ! 
Yes . 
- Good morning , Smitty . 
Oh , God , dear God ! 
Yes , sir ? 
Good luck . 
I 'm not angry . 
- Yes , sir . 
There won 't be any help . 
You are brave and noble soldiers . 
Probably won 't need you till morning . 
Wish I hadn 't did 'em . 
Love unties , like a knot 
- I" m grand . 
Drinking coffee you don" t like , pretending to be mature . 
She liked fame . 
A few friends , a lot of drinking ... 
- Yes . 
- Yes . 
Raise your hands , you" il relax . 
Why are you in this lovely place ? 
That" s lovely . 
- Silly Arab girl , why fall in love ? 
- She" d better go . 
I won 't . 
It 's up to us to extend a helping hand . 
Good . 
We won 't get out of here on the 28th at the rate we 're going . 
Nice quiet little place you have here . 
Freedom 's a heady wine , you know , governor . 
And heaven help you when you are . 
Good- bye . 
She simply succumbed to the bomb . 
Your mother must be very proud . 
Brute strength isn 't everything . 
You smart aleck little punk . 
But singing is relaxing . 
Love is nothing to be ashamed about . 
- Loving a married man ... 
A student sent me a love letter . 
- Take a good look . 
Thanks Cho . 
- Yes ! 
Darling . 
Even if I were to forgive you , the factory won 't . 
You love your child , don 't you ? 
Isn 't it okay if you treat my body like a toy ? 
It 's better to save those who are still living . 
Is this true ? 
That 'll make the living happy . 
Make me the happiest woman . 
Happiness is only for the living . 
- I 'll never find you again in heaven . 
Darling ! 
Certainly not ... that 's for sure ... 
- It 's my only pleasure in life . 
The leadership won 't want to give it the nod . 
Everyone thinks that we make a great couple . 
That 's what makes her interesting . 
That won 't have an impact ! 
- Great ! 
I have a favor to ask of you . 
He 's clever . 
It 's a very effective campaign . 
On the contrary , I 'd like to push back against them ! 
- Certainly not ! 
I 'm not crying because you know everything ! 
Thanks for your concern about my health . 
If nobody trusts me anymore , 
- Yes ... 
- Good evening . 
- Come inside , darling . 
- But if I win , you give me 20 . 
It might be funny , you know ? 
Yes , of course . 
Besides , Alberto won 't marry me and I ... 
My darling , then what ... 
Everything you 're saying is so beautiful , so right ... 
I won 't need to take an evening gown . 
Help me ! 
Tommy , when you get a gift , you don 't ask what it costs . 
- Yeah , well ... 
He was so beautiful . 
About you , darling ? 
Congratulations ! 
And I will thank you never to talk to me or touch me again ! 
Yes , it was rough , rough . 
Well , you can 't win them all . 
- Yes , Sir . 
Mr Monkford will love this clock . 
Shelton never had accomplices to help him . 
Be good enough to leave my garden . 
- Yes . 
Yes , instead of me . 
Please trust in me . 
Let 's be honest . 
Well , I 'm glad you didn 't . 
He will come , but to avoid to make you too happy , 
That 's interesting . 
We 'd better not badger on them here . 
A soldier cares about his exterior ! 
We don 't want a soldier like you . 
Yes , sir . 
We 'd better not badger on them here . 
A soldier cares about his exterior ! 
We don 't want a soldier like you . 
Yes , sir . 
I wish we wouldn 't participate this at all . 
It can 't be true . 
It 's like a divine judgment . 
Everybody are free to go . 
Don 't laugh at me . 
But he 's otherwise good kid . 
Well then , we won 't talk about this anymore . 
Love demands trust . 
You 're a nice boy . 
It is not only an assassin but also a beloved ; ... 
The mind accepts the beauty of your art , the heart does not 
- Then say farewell to love 
I shall change those dreams into reality 
Anarkali shall be presented in the Great Hall 
You are a false promise that changed my faith 
" When one has loved , why should one be afraid ? " 
But who will be responsible for Anarkali 's safety ? 
You reject the Royal Command and the precious reward ? 
" Lord , save my ship ... " " it is drowning " 
Permit me to take her to a safe place 
Justice is more precious than our son 
" Love cannot be killed by blades and swords " 
" Do not stand before death as a mendicant " 
I am the living testimony of that Emperor 's justice 
I think this town is perfect for my recovery . 
I really really like her . 
The moon will be bright tonight . 
Yes . 
You can relax now . 
Thank God . 
Somebody help Nanding ! 
It 's good . 
We licked them good last time , didn 't we , partner ? 
Honey , pretty , you 'd just be sorry tomorrow . 
I reckon you better take the drive to Wichita . 
Sitting up there laughing at us . 
So I gave her promised name to Rachel . 
I wish we could raise nasturtiums . 
- They 're under a sign of peace . 
My own kind ? 
We licked 'em good last time . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Honey , pretty , you 'd just be sorry tomorrow . 
Sitting up there laughing at us . 
So I gave her promised name to Rachel . 
I wish we could raise nasturtiums . 
They 're under a sign of peace , Ben . 
- My own kind . 
We licked 'em good last time . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Honey , pretty , you 'd just be sorry tomorrow . 
Sitting up there laughing at us . ~ Glory , glory , halle ... 
So I gave her promised name to Rachel . 
I wish we could raise nasturtiums . 
They 're under a sign of peace , Ben . 
- My own kind . 
but , my heart is rich with love 
What do I do if I don 't get any support from you ? 
love is such a sweet poison 
Love is the most beautiful truth of Iife ! 
Khan , I am yet alive ! 
Don 't you trust me ? 
He 's a perfect gentleman 
Try as hard as you will you can 't hide being in love 
I 'm going to hand you over to the police 
Try your hardest to hide , I 'll find you , darling 
Try your hardest to hide , I 'll find you , darling 
Brave man . 
I love risks 
We might be of some help 
Yes ? 
It 's fine , not to worry . 
- Alright , do what you like . 
She didn 't do anything , child 's play ! 
It won 't do , it just won 't do ! 
And you , who treats me like a dog ! 
- I 'm happy to see you both again . 
It 's amazing ! 
- Nothing , I 'm just happy . 
Oleg strict but fair . 
And so the team came peace and quiet . 
" Super " . 
What should I do with you , friend ? 
- Good- bye , Captain . 
Hmm ... that 's good . 
Our detective friend has come back again . 
Does that sound good to you ? 
Why won 't you talk ? 
This man is your superior ! 
Hey , regardless of who they are , all human life is precious . 
Well , I like to go to bed early . 
Well , please look around . 
I 'm just doing this to be safe . 
Prop me up , darling . 
We didn 't do very well, yes ? 
Now say you 're sorry , like a good little bear . 
Yes . 
I 've got every confidence in you . 
Very smart . 
Yes , sir . 
Well , thanks for everything . 
C ... Can I help ? 
Oh yes , the face that you did ! 
Lucky you , who still manage to joke . 
Are you betting your honor ? 
- Franco , darling ! 
- Well , if you 're not worried .. 
You won 't catch me now ! 
I felt free , with you . 
Someone who had the courage ... 
And then .. it 'll be easier , won 't it ? 
Yes , I went out last night . 
You 're not the first one they help . 
Lucky you , who have gone from Ferrara ! 
Oh yes , the face that you did ! 
Lucky you , who still manage to joke . 
Are you betting your honor ? 
- Franco , darling !

Greetings , DlG ! 
It 's your responsibility to protect the wealth of the nation . 
It 's my duty to help the police ! 
Yes ! 
Accept it ! 
- Yes ! 
You told me such a big Iie to make me faII in love with you . 
Do you have the courage ? 
- Yes ! 
Yes , she was that girl . 
And enjoy . 
Its better that we go to jail . 
Definitely there is ! 
It 's better for a beautifuI girI to survive ! 
In the form of respectable and reputed man . 
You honest inspector of government and Iaw ! 
Please , help me out . 
Oh , ha ha ha ! 
We 're friends now . 
Just say good- bye . 
You drank it to save my life ! 
[ Pirates laughing and shouting ] 
[ Pirates yelling in agreement ] 
The news are good . 
Our is way better . 
- We won 't be here if you had let me do . 
- We must admit we have some good laugh . 
You already said he 's a good guy . 
I hope he 's not running a fever . 
lf they catch us , we 'll wish we were . 
We have a great task . 
- Yes . 
We have a great task . 
- Yes . 
Because I love my freedom , too . 
See , I speak to you as a friend and you don 't understand me ! 
I was enjoying our chat . 
It 's good to see you again ! 
You 're strong , when you want to be . 
You look marvelous ! 
Do you really love her ? 
I always felt the need to see a friendly face . 
Ah , this is good ! 
" To not suffer , without you ... " 
Well , since you 're so well- informed , let 's talk about it . 
- Yes . 
" Whatever it may be , I won 't let her go . " 
" Please believe me , I 'm not lying . " 
" It snatched the sweet smile from her lips " 
Oh yes ! 
But I 'm happy because you are happy . 
" Yes . 
Life 's joys are momentary 
" But the way I 'm saying this , like I have already got you . " 
Any girl who gets you will consider herself fortunate . 
Give me your hand . 
I won 't get the operation done ! 
It will be better if you leave . 
Who we both loved dearly . 
Please forgive me . 
My garland of dreams is withering 
Mother says Soichi is very nice . 
Yes . 
Don 't you want to help us find who did this ? 
Yes . 
Why must you torment an innocent person ? ! 
- Justice is the … - I got it . 
- OK , let 's roll . 
Who cares ; those old men won 't give up . 
OK , we 'll exercise extreme caution . 
Didn 't you come to help us ? 
Who cares ? 
Maybe it was just a happy coincidence . 
You 've got me , I 'm playing my hand . 
I 'll take that , as promised ! 
I 've got an opportunity here . 
You asked a friend to call Tsunako for you . 
I 'm appealing to the good in you . 
I won 't just barge in the front door . 
She knows her pretty pianist could never give her what I can . 
Listen , please promise me ... 
This should be fun . 
He only likes me . 
My time 's never wasted ! 
I 'll feel better when I can play it for you to the end . 
If someone doesn 't help me out , I 'll go right out of my mind ! 
Yes , I know . 
Yes ... 
Yes ! 
When a woman shows up , it 's farewell Paradise ! 
Yes . 
Your husband was a clever businessman . 
A bit yes , yet it was good . 
- Good night . 
You 'd better not buy yourself a Japanese fan ! 
He plays the lottery because of a dream ! 
- You won 't tell us ? 
Though my mother wrote that I should be good . 
I wanted to be good to everybody . 
I wanted to be good to everybody . 
Do you feel better ?

I never rejected him . 
That would be perfect , if we could pull it off . 
She 's so beautiful . 
Those two are having fun at his expense . 
We were better at that age . 
She was dressed so nicely that I didn 't recognize her . 
Thanks for waiting .

In the day of goodness ... - 
I am useless , but I wish her well . 
Vice Unit head Woo is heard of suspection .

Prosecutor can also love the accused 's daughter . 
Good , we wait until you say it out .

Easy enough to get rid of him . 
It was peace- time The M1 was on a routine exercise

So I ask for my boots Yes the boots of my second cousin Leon 
And " mirliflore " for young man being " pleasant " 
It 's a friend who travelled a lot who sometimes lends it to me 
Oh , but if it doesn 't please you hey , you 're free 
A slap for a laugh on the street we need the one who receives it 
She only came here to learn about acting ... what enthusiasm . 
won 't you say anything ? ... 
Ha ! 
but I still like to think about him ... 
Hey , we did our best ! 
You men have it easy . 
In Kaji 's pouch ... there remains a bit of paradise ! 
Help me , someone ! 
I won 't forget it . 
I 'd be deified and having it easy . 
How to give birth to the country where men are free ? 
I 've come to realize how nice it is to have shelter . 
Let them relax a bit . 
It 's safest ! 
They should take care of us to get out . 
That 's better ! 
I hope we can sleep under a roof tonight . 
But they 're nicer than our own men . 
We think of only eating ... to keep ourselves strong . 
With women ... they might go easy on us . 
Is that true ? 
Great ! 
Yes , Mr. Noge ! 
A serious life isn 't always the best . 
The next are Japanese like you ! 
Not like you to trust in luck . 
Their " Freedom " is phony ! 
Thank goodness . 
Someone help me ! 
How many of us are even capable or worthy of that ? 
I can 't tell you how often I felt like giving up . 
We just wish to ask our way . 
Now I appreciate the value of a roof overhead . 
Glad you 're not the real thing . 
It 's not a dog 's death . 
It 'd be nice to have a roof overhead tonight . 
With women , they might go easy on us . 
Is this true ? 
That 's a good one . 
You enjoy defying your former officers . 
I don 't mind hard labor , but can 't we talk like human beings ? 
They must protect themselves , but it looks like resistance . 
It 's not like you to trust in luck . 
But take down the " peace " and " liberation " signs . 
At 44 ... I 'm pretty browned off , you can take it from me . 
Our great discovery was that life 's the same there as here ... 
He scrimped and saved for that suit . 
I was wondering : are you happy ? 
Without interest or purpose ... 
And not only a failure for me ... 
Because I think he still loves me . 
You couldn 't care less . 
You won 't again . 
So Landry became an African explorer in holiday France . 
The passes are beautiful ... beautiful . 
Such are the joys of provincial life !

And when he left , he had two high hopes : 
Dear God , it is love . 
Trust me . 
She isn 't destined to be the lady to grace any castle . 
The god of love sends me to speak with you , King of the East . 
Even so , he will have known Christian compassion . 
I won honor by the sword , possessions through power . 
The rest was spent on our pretty baby , Assol . 
Yes , Your Grace .

I don 't know , I 'm just trying to do what 's best for everyone . 
And you think it 'll be easier later if she marries Alec now ? 
Yes . 
Thanks for coming down . 
He did a great job , too . 
I 'm just trying to keep things safe around here for everybody . 
We should be careful not to overreact to something like this . 
I wish I could wind back the clock three days . 
Luckily it 's all backed up on my hard drive . .. 
So , how much we win by ?

The bigger the tabbo , the more we like it . 
You 're too nice to them . 
I loved sharing pleasure , but that 's all . 
But sometimes , thanks to my contacts , 
It 's Charlotte I love . 
You never realized I was in love with you ? 
Oh , Faith ? 
That 's a very good idea . 
Would you just lift my hand off ?

You are the most beautiful girl in Samnam , Chun- yang 
Who 's that girl , the most the real beauty ? 
I hope you are alright . 
Master , please help me out here ! 
I don 't care . 
Why do they all have pretty names , 
Doesn 't the constitution define one shall not rape ? 
Take a good care of yourself . 
Since I had a Weird dream , let me interpret my dream , please 
Thank God , you 're still alive . 
He only cares about himself ! 
That can 't be true . 
Why do you care Where I come and go ? 
You 're a good talker . 
I only wish your happiness . 
Please calm doWn . 
NoW I see you , and I Want to live longer , darling . 
Have a strong mind , 
Good idea . 
Yes , sir ! 
He 's playing with the happiness of our child ! 
We need to save the boy ! 
And also , I 'm a dragon head , not a dead frog . 
You know better than that . 
Yes ... ... when you 've nowhere to go . 
Good night . 
Thank you for inviting me to dinner . 
- Yes , you would . 
How soon does your friend want the money ? 
I 'm so happy . 
I just hope it 's not too late to cure it . 
I wish I were a millionaire ! 
Tell the madman to first learn how to treat women ! 
You wear the same jovial look , and talk so sweetly . 
" My heavens lie in the Spring " 
" Say something to me ... " " so I like it among the roses " 
" I 'm a bud in Kashmir ... do not be angry with me " 
You aren 't letting me live in peace here anyway ! 
I won 't eat with you ! 
Chances of surviving are bleak . 
Wow ! 
Thanks a million , God ! 
But she 's so beautiful , so innocent , so naive ... 
Great pancakes ! 
And now we 're in love . 
I wish I could fly home . 
Suppose I say your daughter is in love with me too ? 
What does that laughter mean ? 
I don 't trust my luck . 
It 's true . 
Good God ! 
" I have taken her hand ... for a lifetime " 
- They must 've said it fondly . 
They must 've said it in fun ... can 't you see ? 
The Raja has liked you very much . 
You are really beautiful . 
You gave her your blessings ... and I was satisfied . 
But hearts in love have never surrendered ... they never will ! 
I 'll wish you well " 
I 'll wish you well " 
So you agree that it 's your daughter 's child ? 
Yes , we 're all fine . 
It 's a profitable business ! 
We make sure they get the best of everything ! 
Why don 't we try to free them ? 
It 's certainly not for your sake ! 
Too happy to speak , right ? 
Your beauty is mesmerizing 
He had such a beautiful wife 
Tyuusuke , what 's your pleasure in life ? 
It 's free 
Hi , pretty lady ! 
I want to make Edo women happy 
Better than sleeping on the street ! 
Would you like some help ? 
Yes ! 
Go easy ! 
You save your money for samurais ? 
Thank you ! 
I 'll fix you good ! 
I want to make you happy 
Yes ! 
Such beautiful legs smudged in the mud 
I 've never been so happy ! 
I married the Boss to support the family 
Relax ! 
I want to be rich and powerful 
I want to save some money 
I better go ! 
Thanks for telling me ! 
Yes 
Yes ! 
Are you really happy ? 
I want to go a place where I can live peacefully among women 
I ask you to accept this gift from me , and from my brother . 
You hope that with my help , you can massacre all of them . 
And tell them that they have our support , if needed ! 
I know very well what you mean by " nothing to fear " . 
Above all , we must separate so that Helga can be set free . 
Friendship is sacred , and should not be betrayed ! 
But you will never destroy my people . 
Perhaps you may still be able to save Samia . 
Third time 's the charm , they say . 
I better change . 
That 's good . 
But I 'm proud of you . 
We won 't let it get you . 
Help ! 
We 'll take care of you . 
Third time 's the charm , they say . 
I better change . 
That 's good . 
Are you sure it was wise to come in today ? 
But I 'm proud of you . 
We won 't let it get you . 
Help ! 
We 'll take care of you . 
Her son was my best friend . 
Maybe I can help you . 
You 're the nicest thing that ever happened to me , Tammy . 
How would you like to be hung up in the air like that ? 
Well , I feel funny in my innards . 
Well , I agree but there 's a good chance she may succeed . 
Please keep calm ! 
You love him . 
Well , I felt quite certain that you 'd come in pink . 
You 're very pretty . 
I love the legends . 
Oh , là là là , yes . 
Oh , Kitty darling . 
Yes . 
- and if I am entertaining myself ... 
I love you . 
You 're very attractive tonight , Anna . 
- Yes . 
My love . 
Pray accept my apologies . 
Oh , Alexis , Alexis , be generous . 
- The Lord be thanked . 
Oh , dear , we might be in heaven already . 
- Because I 'm so happy . 
Yes , it 's nine years since I put him into your arms 
- ( He laughs ) 
Anna ... won 't there be any children ? 
When love is gone ... 
I want to be loved , I no longer am . 
You won 't understand if you won 't give in ! 
- Yes , mistress ! 
When we get back , I 'll see you are generously rewarded . 
Who are you , beautiful ? 
I want to stay here because I 've found the man I love . 
As you know it 's the richest city in the Americas . 
Please help us , Father . 
The King will be just as pleased if you hang them here . 
They say all women in love ... are tormented that way . 
True , they 're Moors , we 're Christians -- 
Tell me you don 't love me . 
Until your triumph , my color will be black . 
I hope he does , Your Highness . 
You will be my champion . 
Yes , Your Highness ? 
Yes ! 
They are your friends . 
Now I can take you home to Vivar ... with honors . 
With a few more men we could have won ! 
If he had come , we would have won . 
Yes , Chimene , for you . 
Then your love is as desperate as mine . 
He 'll never die . 
You will need time to recover your strength . 
- Yes .

You just passed across where my sweetheart was playing . 
You 're funny ! 
I hope you learn something from this , and leave that farm ! 
We 'll save them . 
Let 's see if your plan succeeds . 
And three and six for the sexy one . 
That 's nice . 
Good night . 
I trust you pass a peaceful night . 
- That 's rich coming from you . 
- We better phone the police . 
That 's more like it . 
Your lovely boy looks bonkers enough to be one of the family . 
Goodnight Ernie and thanks for trying to protect me . 
Good night Noddy . 
- D 'you think that 's wise ? 
- What a lovely way to go . 
- Linda it 's safer there with me . 
Give us a hand . 
You can 't arrest the world 's greatest hero . 
He just couldn 't save them all . 
[ Laughing ] 
Thanks . 
So , what you 're saying is that he raised false hopes . 
This is about truth and justice , and I 'm doing it . 
Hercules -- half god and hero -- put himself above the law . 
What kind of a friend would do that ? 
They shouldn 't treat you like this . 
You could have a much easier life , you know ? 
- Well , yeah . 
That one man being you -- a hero ? 
You didn 't even ask your own father , Zeus , for help ! 
- He just wanted someone to help . 
- Yes , you get attached . 
- Yes sir 
" Your loving wife , Ruma " 
Give sweets . 
" But your life is more precious . 
" Whether you get happiness or sadness , we will share it . " 
It is good that we did not get married . 
" Anand , you 've done many favours to me . 
" Ok , accept one thing I say . 
Is your love like this ? 
Yes . 
Here is the radio from the charity in the 16th arrondissement ... 
A rich plowman . 
I 'm not made for being loved . 
Never tell Ambroisine you love her . 
Listen , I don 't care about Ronald . 
You don 't care about your car , it 's not about it . 
Money is not vital , it doesn 't make you happy . 
But one day you 'll wake up and you 'll be happy . 
- Good evening , I 'll take your car . 
- Do you want to kiss me again ? 
- I couldn 't help it . 
- Chad , do you think I 'm pretty ? 
What she said, is it true ? 
After all, didn 't professor Clores clearly say so ? 
Alright , I will ... lots of luck 
Yes , it will soon go away 
Funny , Isn 't it ? 
That indicates 240 hundred dollar bills , United States currency 
I would have enjoyed travelling south with you 
Yes, all the symptoms speak for it 
Yes , I think ... 
I hope they will catch and hang the culprit soon . 
So you better go to the Ritz . 
What about the final wish when a man faces the noose ? 
- I really liked him . 
- Break this bow and make him happy . 
In the end Shiva calmed down and blessed Rati 
Our songs of hope ... 
- Kaikayi ... save me , please " 
Your name will mean love and sacrifice 
I won 't be able to do anything . 
So come , let 's fall in love " 
Beautiful ! 
You 're praising me 
Go and help him 
" My respects , O ' wise one . 
Monkeys are very proud of their tails . 
True . 
You will win ! 
Save him somehow , sir " 
They aren 't fit to be humans ! 
- They make fun of us . 
" As long as he doesn 't trust her . 
Please forgive me Lord Rama . 
Whom you praise night and day . 
Truly . 
Two won 't make much difference . 
Think of a better way to draw the men away from the settlement ? 
And I thought it was a party . 
Yes , a few seconds after the shooting . 
It would be a lot easier if he hadn 't . 
There 's nothing but grief in her heart . 
Is it me you 're engaged to or her ? 
I hope so too , doctor . 
- It 's true . 
And that man is still in love with you . 
I think you 're safe for now . 
Yes . 
- Maybe it was better this way . 
- Speak clearly . 
- And he did a good job . 
She was slowly dying , while the two of you were making love . 
Well , now that 's a bit more like it ! 
Please let me help you . 
Oh , must be Cruella , your dearly devoted old schoolmate . 
Perfectly wretched ! 
Old Thunderbolt 's the greatest dog in the whole world . 
I 'll bet they made off with the good silver .

I 'll just go pretty myself up . 
Are you OK ? 
Oh , thanks for the other day . 
They won 't let you just walk out of here , you know ! 
I 'll take real good care of you from now on . 
Knowing that won 't help you now . 
I can 't help it . 
Be a bit nicer ! 
I borrowed them when I hugged him . 
It 's good to live that way . 
Beauty had to be eternal . 
I was happy and tortured like in a love expectation . 
I 'll have it fixed in order to celebrate your return . 
Because Sadako is in love with him . 
Yes . 
You should be happy ! 
She should be proud of it ! 
Hand me your cup . 
You are a glorious Japanese soldier ! 
I saved her . 
He won 't come . 
Take care of the school . 
Have you ever thought about reassuring me ? 
Don 't play the tamed wife ! 
What a nice family quarrel ! 
Thanks . 
You can 't help seeing it . 
I 'm so happy to see you all here . 
I never showed her any affection . 
You just came up with this nice story . 
I finally speak the truth , confessing my love . 
The husband called the lover 
There 's this amazing thing 
It 's only our spiritual cousin having fun 
This very moment she 's with her lover 
You could kiss me 
Prefect , we are honoured to welcome you at this dress rehearsal 
Help , help . 
That 's why Longuevie is good for the general well- being . 
Won 't you come see us anymore ? 
- You clearly never left your town , dad . 
You won 't believe it . 
Yes , we 're all mere mortals . 
I don 't care about his head . 
Are you here to laugh at me ? 
Very good . 
Help . 
He may not be that dead . 
We must respect the rules . 
I saw her clearly . 
Give papa a kiss . 
My father must surely know her . 
The happy day will come when power will pass to the people . 
The pleasure I felt ! 
Here , in this room , you 'll be safe .

I 'm expected in Florida at a party given by the viceroy . 
You enjoyed the dance , isn 't it . 
Let 's return and get back to our respectable work . 
A sword won 't turn a coward into a brave . 
If I 'd succeeded to have Poof following me , 
Let 's bravely criss- cross the seas again . 
- Follow me - You won 't take anybody with you . 
You are a courageous man . 
You 're the happiest man in London . 
They won 't believe you . 
We won 't get out of here before morning . 
Cheer up and be a good girl . 
Peace comes . 
You think you can find a better husband ? 
Liusya and I only wish you well . 
But I did love you . 
Yes . 
- Congratulations ! 
The great struggle is going on ! 
It was him who had saved my life , and Avdeyich 's life too . 
I hope you 're not hurt .

I brought the jewels ... 
Help yourself to some cash . 
He wanted us to help with Arlette . 
Not my idea of a friend ...

- It 's not right when I 'm hoping to be a nun . 
I never knew her drown herself in it as deep as this before . 
Your eyes are beautiful 
She worshipped him . 
- I suppose I 'm as glad of that as you are . 
From what Mama said he was another cheap quack like Hardy . 
Who would ever believe they were once beautiful . 
Please dear . 
- Yes . 
You 're in luck to be hungry . 
- And she promised on her sacred word of honor . 
Hardy . 
Well ... here 's to health and happiness . 
You won 't help me . 
The truth is there is no cure and we 've been saps to hope . 
- Yes . 
Where does Hardy want to send him ? 
What good has it done you ? 
You shouldn 't have bought a second hand automobile . 
You 've done splendidly , I ... 
- I 'm very grateful , honest Papa . 
Someday ... when the blessed virgin Mary forgives me . 
You know doctor Hardy ... 
You 're glad they 've gone . 
Yes indeed ma 'am . 
You couldn 't see your hand in front of you . 
It won 't let you alone . 
I was so relieved and happy when you came . 
Yes , as God is my judge . 
I want to remember only the happy part of the past . 
- He knows I love you most because your my ... 
Yes I hear you . 
I think the best thing for me is to go to bed ... and rest . 
- I have three good sets of Shakespeare you could read . 
- Yes , on property valued at a quarter of a million .

But you feel better today , don 't you ? 
But your father liked it and insisted on building this house and 
Please , dear . 
Yes , yes , of course , I know that . 
I won 't listen when you 're so silly . 
You 're in luck to be hungry . 
And she promised on her sacred word of honor . 
Well ... here 's to health and happiness . 
You won 't help me . 
Dr Hardy ! 
You both flaunted the faith you were born and brought up in . 
Well , I 'll hope . 
Where does Hardy want to send him ? 
What good has it done you ? 
You shouldn 't have bought a second- hand automobile . 
I know Jamie was only seven but he was never stupid . 
You 've done splendidly . 
Someday ... when the blessed Virgin Mary forgives me . 
You know doctor Hardy ... 
You 're glad they 've gone . 
You couldn 't see your hand in front of you .

Yes , as God is my judge , always and forever , Mary . 
I want to remember only the happy part of the past . 
Yes , I hear you , Mama . 
I think the best thing for me is to go to bed ... and rest . 
I have three good sets of Shakespeare there you could read . 
What good have they done her ? 
Yes , on property valued at a quarter of a million . 
I was set free . 
Thanks for telling me your great secret . 
Sure I know you care , Jamie . 
So I had to say I loved her because she was fat . 
Fat Violet is a good kid .

The dead part of me hopes you won 't get well .

We could have had such a good time . 
Easy . 
- I don 't care . 
You 'd better take care of yourself . 
I won 't . 
Oh , Dove ... ... if only you could have given me hope . 
I had a friend . 
You know , it 's funny . 
It 's so easy to make you come back . 
The car is technically perfect . 
He 's smart like you . 
Call me anything you want , if it makes you feel better . 
Selling a company 's secret is breach of trust . 
CLOSED FOR REPAlRS PLEASE USE BATHROOM ON 5TH FLOOR .

He showed his true colors . 
- I don 't care . 
You 've become more like a detective . 
Thanks for telling me . 
But it 's a pretty car . 
He thinks himself better than us . 
Go help him cross the street . 
If you 're wanted , you better stay informed . 
- Smart cat ! 
I never became nasty , rather affectionate . ... Even grotesque . 
Women like reliable values . 
- My triumphal exit ! 
I am so pleased , may I kiss you ? 
- To Joselito , the greatest of all ! 
Like in the Great War .

Are you OK ? 
I give you a toast to our common triumph over the infidels . 
We trusted the Poles .

There 's only one way to keep faith with a Pole . 
- He loves her . 
I love you , Andrei . 
We won 't send out our forces to round up the oxen .

I like to think of it more as a challenge . 
Okay , okay . 
Thank you , God .

Lovely day , don 't you think ? 
I love this job . 
He won 't get far . 
He did 14 years Special Forces detachment Delta .

I was trying to save you . 
Enjoy your new life . 
It 's not bullshit . 
It was the richest port .

Those of your party believe that you are sended from God ? 
Reason for rendergli honor was one . 
I would have entrusted gladly my spirit . 
I name the Great Judge . 
I 've never killed anyone . 
God sends me to fight you hand to hand . 
You won 't know everything . 
To honor my parents who gave it to me . 
We wanted to honor it . 
They love what God loves and hate what God hates . 
I 'm a judge in a matter of faith . 
I appeal to the great Judge . 
I won 't tell everything . 
Could the truth displease God ? 
I 've never killed . <How many soldiers did the king give you ? 
Do those of your party fervently believe you are sent by God ? 
My voices said a great victory will save me here . 
You will come to Paradise " 
They always help in time of need .

You 've been sent to help , have you ? 
I went to a party on Monday night . 
It 's quite a good one , too , judging from the price tag .

I am a free , thinking machine . 
But if I land we won 't be able to return to Earth .

What are you thinking ? it 's easy . 
You tell them to laugh ... they laugh . 
Yes ? 
I won 't join you in Brail . 
There 's no doubt that strength is superior to intelligence . 
The others have an ideal .

Lucky man to have a woman who loved him that much . 
I like to feel the results with my own hand . 
Isn 't this fun ? 
Don 't talk to him like that ! 
Let him have some fun with you . 
Trust me . 
Don 't look at me like that ! 
I really did love him .

- Help ! 
Do you think we 're having fun ? 
- Yes ... 
His care , his looks , his words ... 
- But so rich , Father , very , very rich ! 
Oh , the pretty Gigogin ! 
You must respect the line ! 
- Yes ! 
Concetta isn 't interested in him at all ! 
He always wins . 
Were it even to give them beautiful gifts . 
- Good- bye , Chevalley . 
I 'm sorry , but it 's not my fault . 
- Yes , you 're right , Fabrizio . 
I 'm sure my sheets won 't be as clean ... 
You are much more than a good dancer . 
She 's still in love with you , I 'm afraid . 
Hey , good woman ! 
Do you think we 're here for fun ? 
Algeria is very different , my dear ! 
These are just a romantic schoolgirl 's fantasies . 
Pretty . 
Would you do me the honor of accepting a modest sip ? 
And I 'd so hoped he would marry Concetta ! 
Her sheets must smell like paradise . 
Good only for ambushes and looting . 
I wonder how much they paid to free him . 
Very amusing . 
Good- bye . 
Sorry , but it 's not my fault . 
You look wonderful . 
It 's a miracle if he comes in here once a year . 
It 's only natural , with such a smart , good- looking uncle . 
I wish this ball would never end . 
She 's still in love with you .

Winner by decision of the judges , Marcel Lelac ! 
You 're nice Pina . 
The truth , simply the truth . 
It will be perfect . 
Can 't I just play without being bothered ? 
Anyway , I 've been very glad that you came back . 
It won 't last .

If we can get those muskets , we wiII be very powerful ... 
They aren 't suitable for this , nothing but dead trees . 
If you take care , you can Iive at Ieast 30 more years . 
You are a good man . 
You better get out of here . 
He was a good man . 
It 's easy , just give them some money . 
Kichi , you 're alive ! 
Good morning , madam . 
Your father talked the best words . 
- Nice young couple ! 
We must not fail . 
- The underground is rich . 
You 'll love ever . 
There goes another , because I I love Palma . 
Trust is the secret of happiness . 
And you had to paddle the opportunity to xanaskypseis ! 
To tell her that sends kisses ? 
I liked to whack your sight . 
Just when I begun to love you ! 
It is easy to put down ! 
Where is my strength ; 
He 's got luck . 
I won 't forget this ! 
It won 't be easy . 
Shouldn 't they live happily ? 
You cannot kill me , can you ? 
He 's got luck . 
I won 't forget this ! 
It won 't be easy .

You cannot kill me , can you ?

I won 't forget this ! 
It won 't be easy . 
Shouldn 't they live happily ? 
You cannot kill me , can you ? 
Nattering on until she heard you were safe . 
Looks OK to me . 
You couldn 't even do a good job of blowing your brains out ! 
Wonderful . 
He 'd better get some sleep now . 
I thought you were my friend . 
I was innocent , I managed to escape . 
I hope I have a friend like you to cover up for me . 
Help ! 
Uh , I- I- I 'd better go finish breakfast now . 
It 's all very easy for you , Gerard . 
Slow and easy . 
Yes , sir . 
You better tell me why it took you so long . 
Yes , send a car down for me at the store . 
Thanks . 
Well ... that sure looks nice , Mike . 
He 's lucky I don 't break his neck . 
But does that make him fair game for men like Dan Murdy ? 
She must have put up a pretty good fight . 
Goodnight , darling . 
All friends . 
I 'm glad you came . 
Get yourself some help . 
I like to keep Tucson clean as its air . 
I 'm just trying to help his wife and boy . 
My only hope was to find the man with one arm . 
The law isn 't perfect . 
Well , I know , dear . 
Sure I can 't give you a hand with this wood ? 
She has a -- A fantastic imagination . 
You know what my friends used to -- ? 
I need your help . 
Jenny , will you help me ? 
You mean you haven 't got any friends ? 
She can be real handsome in a dress . 
I wish ... 
Hey , good evening . 
I know it isn 't the applause or the cheers . 
( laughs ) : 
Oh , great . 
Better go back to where you came from . 
Yes , I know . 
Actually , last year , I was Colorado state champion . 
He loves ocean travel . 
Glad to have you . 
Yes . 
Your friends aren 't here today . 
' cause he was brave and saved some guy 's life . 
Look , Millie , they got help for people like Joe . 
I wish I could sleep ! 
Not doing the carpet any good . 
Now , look , mister , all those labels are clearly marked . 
To love someone who needed to be loved ? 
From everything I can learn , they were friends . 
Relax . 
Maybe we 'd better check . 
I hear you 're smart . 
But a rich one . 
I hope so . 
Yes . 
Well , like you say , 
( Reed laughing ) 
She likes that one . 
Or I should say rich little Annie . 
I , uh , want her to be perfect , so I push too hard . 
Sure , I 'm good . 
Somebody had better shut him up . 
( men laughing ) 
I don 't care . 
Now , h- have you ever taken a good look at yourself ? 
I need a big story right now , and this could win me a Pulitzer . 
And Mike says he 's gonna try to help you find him ? 
Honest , I ... 
We just gotta relax . 
You -- You won 't forget , huh ? 
You won 't get a fourth of what this place is worth . 
I always liked this room . 
I won 't keep her out too long . 
Man , you don 't trust nobody , do you ? 
Ha- ha . 
Well , I hope your trip 's a short one . 
You are very funny ... 
You haven 't accomplished a thing , have you ? 
I came to love him very much . 
Ah , I 'd better just stick with the wood . 
Well , I better get going and round up the driver . 
We won 't be sure until we have him in one of our cells . 
Well , the sooner we find out , the better . 
Well , he likes you a lot . 
Whatever you did , I don 't care . 
He saved your town . 
Now , that 's an interesting puzzle . 
You 're just like all the rest ! 
You see , maybe they won 't believe you . 
We have to go in to eat lunch pretty soon . 
It 's fun . 
He won 't squeal on you . 
Oh , what a wise guy you are . 
From the gentlest man I ever knew . 
I don 't want your approval . 
Why did you have to be a nice guy ? 
And she 's in love with you . 
I waited an hour to do you a favor . 
You were glad to get the contract . 
Next time , Jack gets us a nice little dam . 
Well , maybe I like it inside . 
That ain 't quite true , Mr. Potter . 
Yes , sir . 
Listen here , Tad , I 'm your friend . 
Well , we got a free show out of you , anyhow . 
How good are you at barracuda ? 
The job is to care for him . 
Well , good night . 
I got a good idea . 
And I wonder , did I really try to save that hitchhiker ? 
This is Rusty , my one true love . 
And you hope it 's a slip of the tongue . 
Ha- ha ! 
I 'll take care of the release . 
Be truthful , Mr. Mayor , 
Yes , I remember . 
Yes . 
I had better hand in my badge , hadn 't I ? 
Is it really so important to you ? 
You know , what you 're asking me to do isn 't easy . 
That boy actually worshipped you . 
You would have made a good lawyer yourself , doctor . 
Nobody liked Briggs too much . 
Justice , Roy . 
Nobody 's gonna care . 
I 've taken care of everything . 
I hope they get you . 
I 'm glad I don 't have to get any . 
You go up to your room and have a nice rest before dinner . 
That 's why my friend ran away . 
Not to my friend . 
Is it true ? 
( laughs ) 
Good . 
I come by to do an old buddy a favor . 
A man like him makes it rough for the good outfits . 
You know better than that . 
Yes . 
Nobody could have saved her . 
That 's why you 're going to help me change it . 
Good . 
Like I said , she 's probably okay . 
I 'm still a better man than you or your Barney Vilattic . 
What good you figure it 's doing to help Pinky , anyway ? 
Well , well . 
Well , it looks like I 'm less primitive than either of you . 
Uh , well , some of them just because they like to . 
Well , as you must have noticed , our prodigal likes his women . 
Good . 
Oh , come off it , Ellie , you 're in love with him . 
I wanna help you both . 
I hoped you 'd want to help your daughter . 
Maybe I am , but I 've gotta make sure . 
Yes . 
Whatever darling wanted , darling got . 
Easy boy , easy . 
The best in the business . 
He can 't help it and I -- 
How can I help it ? 
I hope so . 
She makes just about the best cookies in town . 
Now , you be a very good boy and don 't try anything . 
Why should I help him ? 
I 'm glad , Samuel . 
Good night . 
Yes . 
I loved him very much . 
Just so you love me now . 
Relax . 
I better just try the thumb and the middle finger . 
Good , Richard . 
Yes . 
Really free , like you 're all alone in the world . 
Or maybe it 's good . 
After faithful service , as my husband would say . 
Oh , yes . 
( cheerful music stops ) 
You 've got to help me . 
Now , whether you want to believe it or not , she does need help . 
Now , Tony , you were a good friend of Brubaker 's . 
Too chicken to admit you 're innocent . 
Well , I suppose I might as well tell you . 
Well , he seems to have done pretty well in spite of it . 
I need your help . 
I 'm not lying , so help me , I swear . 
Care for a belt ? 
He 's dedicated . 
Okay , just take it easy , will you ? 
I 'm gonna be an old maid , but they make excellent witnesses . 
I 'm not a murderer . 
Well , sure I can give you a description . 
Honest , honey , he was ... 
I don 't care . 
Yes . 
( laughs ) 
It can 't do you any good . 
All you have to do is take it easy . 
Better get the children out of here right now . 
Honest , I didn 't . 
I still have a few friends in this town . 
Yes . 
Yes , I know . 
Just when it was getting interesting . 
I know it isn 't funny . 
Yes . 
It could 've been so great . 
Thanks , anyway . 
Lieutenant , we see what we want to see , isn 't that true ? 
I loved it . 
I 'll get some help . 
This thing has two barrels on it and I won 't miss twice . 
Easy , pal . 
Be grateful it didn 't happen to you . 
Now , you 're gonna get all the care you deserve . 
Was he a friend of yours ? 
I 'm glad of that . 
You 're giving up your parole , your freedom . 
He was the best friend I ever had . 
Oh , boy , am I glad to see you , lieutenant . 
He 's a good kid . 
It 's a lucky thing you spotted him when you did . 
I thought you liked it . 
We were hoping you 'd call . 
She 's just so happy to hear from you . 
I imagine she 's had it pretty rough . 
That girl 's had nothing but misery . 
Yes , I 'm about 45 miles from town . 
Please , let me help you . 
Yes . 
I said please and thank you . 
Yes , sir . 
Well , you better go and save those decent people of yours . 
Listen , you better stick around , see ? 
He figures he 's safe with them . 
Yes , sir , we could . 
With strength ! 
You don 't deserve the gift God gave you . 
He is a brilliant teacher . 
I admire him for that . 
Oh , good evening , officer . 
If I can help you with it , all you have to do is ask . 
That 's why I 'm so good at parties . 
Love , attention , comfort . 
Yes , I remember . 
There are better men than you on every corner . 
That 's not gonna do any good . 
Now , give me a hand . 
I don 't care what happens to me ! 
Like you said , I 'll just be carrying out his sentence . 
( laughing ) 
( laughs ) : 
That means that Tucker is practically a free man now . 
That 's why you 've got to help me . 
Told him all his friends had turned their back on him . 
You don 't want to be a free man . 
( laughing ) : 
It appeared to be a nice home . 
( laughing ) : 
Someone you thought you cared for . 
Well , I 'm surprised . 
You 're working yourself up to doing something brave . 
Your confessing isn 't going to help him one bit . 
Yeah , thanks a lot . 
What about the safety catch on the helmet , Pete ? 
Dear God . 
It 's Dave Bliss . 
The idea is perfect . 
Now he 's getting involved himself , the risk might be too great . 
Thanks for coming , Burt . 
Oh , that one time he got lucky . 
I 'm pretty sure it 's on Avadale Street . 
Look , I don 't care about us . 
Relax and enjoy it . 
looking for a hand out . 
We 're giving this party . 
You better get going . 
Then Josephus will take care of her . 
Now help me get her to the car . 
That 's good . 
But as a doctor he 's a great bee keeper . 
Good turnout , though . 
Then , Josephus will take care of her . 
Now help me get her to the car . 
I 'm glad you could make it in time . 
Good . 
It must bevery nice traveling together , just you and your wife . 
Now I realize you didn 't trust me like I thought you did . 
I think it 's better if you go on without me . 
Yes , I 'm sure Shimozuma did it . 
I can help you . 
She must have been very pretty . 
Hisa , help me ! 
I run an honest business ! 
I 'm so glad you got away from them . 
He convinced him to go . 
It must bevery nice traveling together , justyou and yourWife . 
NoW I realizeyou didn 't trust me like I thoughtyou did .

Yes , I 'm sure Shimozuma did it .

Hisa , help me !

I wish I could see that ! 
He won 't come . 
Can 't get any better . 
Very funny ! 
Take it easy , Sinkitsi ! 
Yes . 
It isn 't good cold . 
- I hope you 're right . 
I wanna be beautiful , like Osei . 
Very beautiful woman . 
I proudly accept that I am boss Kutsinawa . 
You know me so well .

- I 'm in love , Mr Director . 
Our party might coincide with the renovations . 
Energetic as always , Martin ? 
I won 't be alone for long . 
You 're taking it easy . 
Please apologise . 
Yes , I did . 
The medal proves it . 
Help , our company 's exploding . 
Think how proud Mrs Brossard would be . 
I won 't ask him anything . 
- Put some sugar , it 's very good . 
" Thanks , Carmen ! " 
Thanks to you ! 
She 's sleeping like a log ! 
Yes . 
- Calm down , baby , calm down ! 
I won 't move away from here !

Yes ! 
Thanks ... 
Greetings ! 
Please forgive me ... 
Here you are . - " ... the house . " - Yes . 
Calm down , Calm down ! 
I won 't greet anybody ! 
I won 't go alone ... 
It won 't arrive ! 
Yes , but I don 't care about the flat yet ! 
Come , my love , come ... 
Sugarcane spells wealth . 
That isn 't true , Eleanor . 
You will tell me everything , won 't you , Tony ? 
Yes , you do , all the time . 
You 'd better get back to sleep . 
Won 't you leave him anything ? 
( Gentle birdsong ) 
- Little Eleanor safely tucked up ? 
Dear God . 
That isn 't true , Eleanor . 
And I don 't care much any more . 
- You are happy , aren 't you , Tony ? 
- Oh , yes , you do . 
You better get back to sleep . 
That isn 't true , Eleanor . 
And I don 't care much any more . 
- Oh , yes , you do . 
You better get back to sleep . 
Yes , of course ! 
Someone else is taking care of that . 
I was hoping you wouldn 't notice till dinner . 
It 's great you 're here . 
Nonetheless , thank you for the compliments . 
To everything we love . 
Germany needs new self- confidence . 
Who 's gonna kiss me ? 
Who would sacrifice his intelligence ? 
You 're going to Russia for fun ? 
Yes . 
I feel that I fit into you quite well . 
I 'd better tell Alan . 
Bob Conner , I 'll need your help . 
Do we pray , or do we merely run now and pray later ? 
That 's a gorgeous solution . 
Starvation is at hand . 
You promised to devote yourself to teaching . 
You 're not a violent man . 
Thanks , Gwyilm . 
These are heavy burdens , great drainers of creative energy . 
Will we be able to manipulate the intelligence and the memory ? 
I thought surely they 'd fixed it this time . 
Does this help ? 
Then I would be very happy . 
I won 't let you go . 
I don 't care . 
Maybe they do , if they don 't find peace . 
I love you . 
Yes . 
Let 's hope she 's free of him forever . 
I 'd like to have his friendship .

Friends and comrades ...

What a beautiful" sonata " ! 
Well , well , Monk . 
Help yourself . 
Besides , we never dreamt the war would ever touch New York . 
- Good day to you , Mulraney . 
Good . 
North and South must stand united ! 
God , forgive me . 
He makes peace with me . 
It means , if you 're not strong , you 'd better be smart . 
This was a great man . 
Sure you know I 'd never do you harm . 
I could spare half a dozen of you easier than I can spare him . 
Please , please .

An honest policeman came on the beat . 
You 're beautiful . 
- She 's got the best location . 
It was a great loss to all of us . 
Yes , and it was such a jolly marriage , those first few years . 
They can 't help you . 
You only love that 500 francs twice a week . 
- You look lovely . 
Oh , it 's gonna be such fun bringing her up .

That 's an interesting place to have a tattoo . 
- Welcome . 
We saw something good tonight . 
You 're too good for the likes of me . 
You won 't see me again . 
If only you 'd married Morooka , I could peacefully go to Edo . 
God help him . 
- Yes . 
We saw something of splendid this evening . 
I hope more to re- examine you . 
Sensei , please give me the hand of your sister in marriage . 
Owner , you are not a magpie robber , isn 't this ? 
That God forgives him .

You can trust me , sweetheart . 
Doctor , they kept him alive ! 
I couldn 't save your world . 
It 's true . 
Yes , I would . .. Thank you . 
Oh , that 's nice . 
SHE GlGGLES Mercy ! 
Bundle of laughs , you are . 
Bye bye , darlings . 
Better with two . 
I don 't care . 
The best short story ever written ! 
I pushed boxes at the Boston Tea Party . 
That 's no sort of answer ! . You ask her , she won 't tell me . 
The nations of the world are watching the United Kingdom . 
I thought so - just too perfect . 
Now , you 're safe in my flat . 
You saved my life ! 
Yeah , he 's not so stupid after all . 
This beautiful place . 
Yes . 
We 're safe - the Earth is safe ! 
What , and that 's funny , is it ? 
It 's just like this great big pepperpot . 
Remember that , OK ? 
It was the prize of my collection ! 
Oooh , I love it ! 
Yes ! 
Thanks . 
Yes . 
I only wish there 'd been someone there for him . 
Do you think it never occurred to me to go back and save them ? 
There 's a man alive in the world who wasn 't alive before . 
Maybe it 's a godsend , gives you time to think . 
I play around , and bring her to meet the missus ! 
No , love . 
Did you give my daughter a second- hand name ? 
It 's brilliant . 
Scarring on the back of the hand . 
They 're not dead ! 
And powerful . . . it doesn 't know it yet . 
You 're the one that keeps us safe . 
Good little soldiers . 
Taken care of it . 
I 've put it in stasis , but it won 't last long ! 
Oh , the Doctor 's very good at teleports . 
How strong is your stomach ? 
Nice to meet you , Blon . 
Obviously they survived . 
Humans are allowed to live here by kind permission of my client . 
I 'm gonna play to win ! 
I told you to keep an eye on him , not kill him . 
Ha- ha , I knew it ! 
OK , move away from the desk . 
Obviously , they survived . 
They survived through me ! 
Obviously they survived . 
They survived through me . 
Only one cell in a billion was fit to be nurtured . 
Yes ! 
I will not die ! 
I 'm trying to help you , Matron . 
But she 's fine , she 's good . 
Charity Martha . 
Only the menfolk have the capacity for true perception . 
Yes , it always happens to me when I’ m cold . 
Surely we’ ve changed the future by now ? 
Yes , I think I can quite understand your sentiments , young man . 
Nevertheless , they‘ il try and contact our visitors for help . 
Well , either way , it’ s our chance . 
If they agree to help us . 
We were hoping they would . 
Well , surely one or other of you saw or heard something ? 
I am not irritable ! 
I just wish he’ d stay with us for once , that’ s all . 
Well , think what your superiors are going to say . 
Well , a very small army can easily keep control . 
Well you can’ t just accept it ! 
It’ s skin is interesting isn’ t it ? 
Yes yes , well , let’ s go a bit further . 
Yes . 
What a fantastic size ! 
Yes , I know . 
You just rest easy , Mm ? 
It sounded more like an ancient cannon ! 
Yes , it’ s rather widespread I’ m afraid . 
Oh yes . 
Yes , what’ s happening here ? 
And if that seems callous , well alright , it is ! 
Oh yes . 
Oh , I wish I could do something to help you . 
Well , yes ... 
Yes I am a bit . 
Yes ... 
This is pressurised , it’ s a spray kind . 
Hah- ha ! 
We both want to get away but its no good building up our hopes . 
Planet Dido to rescue ship . 
Dear dear dear dear dear . 
Yes , never mind about all that . 
The Mir rescue ship is due to arrive . 
That’ s better , that’ s better . 
Yes , well , so might I have done ! 
Good gracious me , you mustn’ t behave like that ! 
When we get back to Earth she’ d support my story . 
So you are a friend of the gladiators , are you ? 
This will make a nice dress don’ t you think so , Barbara ? 
Yes , well , which market ? 
Friends , Romans , Countrymen ! 
Yes , thank you , that’ s better . 
I’ m sure even Nero can play better than that ! 
Yes , I know . 
Yes , both broaches are very attractive . 
Great Jupiter ! 
I’ il teach you to boil me alive ! 
Yes , thank heavens I got you in time . 
Doctor , it was wonderful ! 
He must know that I am the greatest talent in the world . 
Yes , yes . 
My dear boy , I could kiss you ! 
I can charm the nightingales out of the trees ! 
I made him as comfortable as possible and came to get help . 
The other movie people was right friendly . 
Please , no , please ! 
We come in peace . 
I was only trying to get something to protect us ... ! 
Oh , I should like to meet these Rills ! 
For goodness sake ! 
Yours must be a very interesting civilization . 
We 've succeeded . 
I shall feel easier if one of you remain behind . 
Do you know , this is a nice piece of building ! 
In order to save him , the other two must help us . 
For their friends ? 
Good . 
Oh , but still your glory shines through ! 
Have a care , pirate ! 
I must go out and help . 
If you so insist , I shall be most happy to oblige , Lightfoot ! 
Yes , that is so . 
I think it would be much safer on the whole . 
Yes , fling a thunderbolt or some such , do . 
Well go back and wait until he gets his courage up ! 
Yes . 
I thought he was rather nice ! 
Excellent ! 
Ah , but I have another idea ... and a much better one ! 
Good luck you call it . 
Just a hope . 
I 'm very glad I did , Doctor . 
You are reserved for Agamemnon and he 's welcome to you ! 
My dear child you 're not dead ! 
In fact , it would probably make him more determined . 
Help ! 
I had to hand the real Taranium Core over to Mavic Chen . 
That means that the Daleks have won ! 
The operation is a complete success . 
Not if we save them . 
Take care , Kingdom . 
The Doctor 's gone to get help . 
Yes , well whoever this Bret is , he 's quite right 
Well , I think that should do the trick , my dear . 
You know you can trust me ! 
I 'm afraid I may not be able to help it . 
Good . 
Well it couldn 't be , just like that . 
What 's the matter , my dear , hmm ? 
Here , I reckon we 'd charm the birds of the trees ! 
Why won 't you sit down , lad ? 
Great ! 
Yes , their greed for power is so great that they can be trusted . 
Especially as the weather 's been holding off so well . 
Yes , yes , quite , quite . 
Yes , that 's right . 
You won 't get in . 
Yes . 
- Yes . 
I shall speak to them peacefully . 
Yes , if they really want to listen . 
And you wouldn 't lift a finger to help yourselves . 
Perhaps the Daleks are more interested in people ? 
If we get this intelligent anticipation , we shall succeed . 
I do hope you know what you 're doing ! 
Ha ! 
Well played Steven , my boy , well played ! 
Yes- yes , quite so , quite so . 
Well maybe you won 't have to . 
They may as well be if they win this way . 
Yes ! 
Yes , and it 's coming from Professor Brett 's office ! 
Test satisfactory , effective at thirty feet . 
Don 't tell me that you believe this fantastic story , Doctor ? 
Oh my dear Sir Charles ! 
We are not wasting time my dear boy ! 
Yes , like a tank ... it has about twenty men with it . 
Alright then , when you 're ready go ahead . 
Oh yes , this is all very simple . 
For the moment your help is needed here . 
- Yes he does . 
You know I ‘ ate this , but it 's for your own good ! 
Good heavens ! 
There you are my child , it 's nice to see you so well again . 
- Yes , they 'll radio ahead . 
I rather enjoyed that ! 
- Will you help collect the old man ? 
We 're hungry but we 're not starving . 
I just think it 's wonderful . 
Ann was a hero to have worn it ! 
( CAROLE ) Top of the ten best- dressed men list ! 
- Yes . 
Not a choice I 'd like to face ! 
- That 's true enough ! 
( SHE LAUGHS ) 
The explosion will take care of that . 
I 'll make this look as good as new . 
Yes , you little monkey . 
( LAUGHTER ) 
We 'll collect your friends later . 
Do you expect people to welcome you with open arms ? 
- Yes . 
You can 't help him now . 
Once you 're on board a saucer , there isn 't a hope . 
( GARY ) The Daleks had a fantastic voice . 
It was like kids playing . 
A perfect example of it really ! 
( VERlTY ) I love this bit . 
A very clever man . 
Now , you 're safe in my flat . 
You saved my life ! 
Yeah , he 's not so stupid after all . 
This beautiful place . 
Yes . 
We 're safe - the Earth is safe ! 
He won 't . .. That 's strange . 
Please , help ! 
OK , where are his things ? 
Yes . 
Isn 't that true ? 
You will help me do that , understand ? 
He has opened the Eye of Harmony ! 
Grace , I need to fix it ! 
- With me , Grace ? 
I can 't make your dream true forever , but I can today ! 
Give me your hand . 
Pippig and I will take care of you . 
- Good evening . 
Good brother . 
The Party put Walter in charge of protecting the child . 
When we have the child , we 'll have the Party . 
Those birds won 't sing . 
What then , my friend . 
It 's good that way . 
At ease ! 
- Come clean , Leonid . 
You know better than I how many guns we have . 
Pippig and I will take care of you .

I don 't care ... 
- She 'd better not . 
- I 'm not lying ! 
- Yes . 
Good day , Inspector . 
She 's a lady and a great horsewoman . 
I was hoping you 'd stay for our dance . 
It was clever of me , wasn 't it ?

She 's terrific . 
Well , he liked my suggestion . 
- It 'll be all right , sweetheart . 
He needs cheering up . 
Take it easy , Benny . 
I 'd better be going . 
- I think I 'd make a better producer . 
Sweetie , I promise you .

Are we safe ? 
Go on , and win . 
Your son 's safe . 
Don 't celebrate yet . 
From the way he talks , he seems intelligent . 
Please save him ! 
The Chief has set up a special section . 
You may say I 'm callous , but I won 't pay the ransom . 
Plenty of men richer than me . 
Anyway , Shinichi is a smart boy . 
He 'll get away clean . 
Don 't they care about public opinion ? 
It 's a great help .

- She said you weren 't lovers . 
Please forgive me , Madame Victoria . 
Why don 't you love me ? 
We better beat it . 
I want to glorify and immortalize my name . 
- Just like you ! 
Just like you ! 
Certainly , my dear Etik . 
For them , she 's a valuable hostage

Maybe this will help to open the eyes of the clan officials 
It won 't happen this time 
Never mind , I can take care of myself 
Be clever , make it look like the work of prowlers 
He 's the one who saved me 
Are you not angry ? 
I must rescue him 
Please forgive me 
Is that true ? 
Quiet , be quiet , won 't you ? 
You 'll be safe in this room

Now that 's funny too . 
I can set you free . 
You 're free to go . 
You lead a comfortable existence at your father 's home . 
It 's always good to get rid of the vermin . 
We 're gonna have some fun .

He saved my life . 
You think you saved the peasants , don 't you ? 
Is it true ? 
Good bye .

Up , up , there 's a good dog . 
- I hope so . 
This is a funny house , isn 't it ?

I won 't have it .

You 're the best .

Saved from Don Secundino Colmenero 's yard . 
My friend would help you that 's sure . 
That you could get rich and famous at my expense ? 
I know an easier way to win a lot of money . 
Good night . 
I 'm not sad , only bored which is not the same . 
Let 's go before they clean us out . 
I know him , I have already won with him .

I want to make you happy , my dear . 
It was a great show ! 
Take care of your son . 
I miss her a great deal . 
I am free . 
Calm down , please ! 
They won 't think anything . 
Life is good . 
If you 'll allow me , I 'd be honored to escort you . 
Oh , then he must be very smart . 
Now , take it easy , Caryl . 
Good . 
- That sounds wonderful . 
- Will you relax ? 
- Sure , yeah . 
I 'll be my own charming , natural self . 
You can count on me to be in a very dignified vein . 
If he didn 't have that peculiar habit of howling like a wolf , 
Yes . 
You 'd better go down there and straighten him out . 
Why don 't you take a nice , long walk in the night air ? 
We all love you anyway , Grandpa . 
They all love it . 
Seems like all the really nice resorts are gone . 
I do wish Herman hadn 't slept so late . 
Oh , thank goodness . 
I can 't help it if my mother was a woman . 
Mr. Pike , you won 't get away with this ! 
Oh , yes . 
Delicious . 
Eddie won 't be ready for college for a long time yet . 
[ Laughing ] 
But satisfaction brought him back . 
I won 't tell anyone your secret . 
How could you do this to us after the way we trusted you ? 
Well , I think it 's disgraceful , beneath the family 's dignity . 
Well now , Lydia , darling . 
Y- Yes , sir . 
L- I won 't go to a hospital ! 
[ Laughing ] 
I 've got it all ready . ?? 
Oh , dear ! 
To wake this sleeping beauty , you must remember this . 
Yes , uh ... 
And- And you want me to kiss her ? 
Wonderful . ! 
Yes , Aunt Lily , I will . 
I won 't leave the house . 
- Help ! 
I wouldn 't want you to do a thing like that , my boy . 
Good boy . 
Oh , Herman , you 're always so optimistic . 
He won 't be with us for the holidays . 
Excuse me , dearie . 
Oh , I won 't say a thing . 
I better get going . 
Good- bye . 
That 's nice . 
When the matter , thank heavens , will be out of my hands . 
Good Grandpa . 
Grandpa , how do I know if the food 's good in the New York Zoo ? 
Easy does it , Grandpa . 
I 'll take care of this . 
Those nice men might yell at me . 
I 'm just trying to get some music so I can relax . 
[ Laughing ] 
There 's nothing that can hurt Grandpa . 
Yes . 
Easy , boy . 
Help ! 
I 'm a rich man . 
Gee , thanks , Eddie . 
Oh , I 'm glad they didn 't buy our house . 
I won 't let anyone get away . 
Well , I 'm glad it happened . 
In my business , we always let people down gently . 
Yeah , well , it don 't actually hit you . 
It 'll be neat , having a father who 's a real movie star . 
It 's your sweetheart . 
What sweetheart ? 
I might even report you to the Better Business Bureau . 
So I won 't make a million dollars sponging off you . 
You know , Lily , I 'm going to love it . 
Well , maybe we 're getting our hopes too high . 
[ Laughing ] 
It 's real neat having you back , Pop . 
Yeah , well , let 's get out of here . 
Here , help me pull it off ! 
But , Lily , it 's true ! 
[ Laughing ] 
Oh , dear ! 
[ Applause ] 
Well , that 's better than nothing . 
Good idea . 
They certainly take advantage of him down there . 
Yes , dear , and for such a low salary . 
Boy , you very good . 
Okay , Pop , how did you save a boy 's life ? 
Let me hug you . 
You like it like that ? 
Cousin can’ t give me money , he needs them to help Fronde 
Of course , rich husband it is always good . 
Good night , Madame . 
Young man was very persistent , but girl was a better swimmer . 
I didn’ t love anyone like that in my life 
You’ re gorgeous . 
Ah you’ re my cutie , I’ m glad to help you . 
Excellent ! 
- Help anyone , save me ! 
Wonderful . 
Good By ! 
I’ ve found him with great effort . 
King doesn’ t like indecisive people and doesn’ t trust them . 
Way is free ! 
You are in safety . 
Get a bonfire ready ! 
- Yes , sold ! 
It looks like excrement ! 
- Excuse me , Your Grace . 
A respectable tradition . 
Please allow me to retire . 
You 're beautiful . 
You amaze me , Peyrac , 
Don 't laugh . 
Yes , I shall have you one day ! 
Sir , save me ! 
You , my beauty ? . 
- That was my last day of happiness . 
- Help ! 
You won 't feel a thing . 
- I saved you then . 
Let her make her peace .

They didn 't succeed , I see . 
He 's going to help us . 
- ls this true ? . 
Then they 'll be safe . 
This is the last night I play cards with you lot ! 
We better wake up Ignacia . 
How Dad loved the pears from the orchard ! 
[ applause and boos ] 
Surely . 
God has forgiven her . 
She had such nice clothes ! 
You 're so good , in everything . 
I don 't feel so good . 
You look better , too . 
Haha ! 
I 'm happy to check for you free of charge ! 
Or like a lover . 
I will help you . 
I deserve better ! 
I ask you to please leave the room and not interrupt ! 
Yes , sir . 
The results of my test were encouraging . 
Those are good omens , Matt . 
Because when you love somebody , nothing can hurt you .

Well , calling Mr. Sharpe " Shorty " didn 't help . 
Mother , I hope you 're joking . 
Good . 
Would you like me to help ? 
Okay , Aunt Clara , I 'll try and help . 
The guests love him . 
Hey , you 're a clever lass . 
We 're glad to see you anyway . 
You should be very proud of your niece . 
I think I 'll try some nice loud music . 
I 'm perfectly relaxed and calm . 
It would have made a delightful conversation piece . 
Have you made any progress with Tabatha ? 
Yes . 
Yes , thank you . 
I 'm the only one that can quiet her , so I 'd better go . 
Miss Pleasure O 'Riley . 
Now , you remember what you faithfully promised . 
Because I won 't go back to him . 
In that case , you better call the police . 
I 'm at 1123 Morning Glory Circle . 
That 's always a good sign . 
I think we better discuss the champagne . 
Yes . 
You know I love you . 
Samantha , I love you . 
- Well , that wasn 't very nice . 
- Yes , I can see that . 
Welcome to my home such as it is . 
Who cares , it 's the first good trick in the act . 
What about that artist friend of yours , Kermit ? 
You 're a delightful surprise . 
I 'm glad I finally got the chance to tell you off . 
I 'll show you how to treat it . 
Oh , yes . 
Hello , dears . 
She was only trying to help . 
Better get going . 
It wasn 't a good day . 
Well , don 't commit yourself . 
I feel wonderful . 
It 's made me very happy . 
It 's lively . 
Good night , dear . 
It certainly is a pleasure . 
I 'll buy that , until you can think of something better . 
I 'll take care of you later . 
- I think he 's kind of cute . 
I see you 're entertaining . 
You did the honourable thing . 
Endora , you can 't win them all . 
That won 't be necessary . 
Yes , and so does Endora . 
- Yes . 
Is he feeling better ? 
I like to please people . 
Now , you do all these wonderful things yourself ? 
The North won . 
Well , he likes them and he 's our guest . 
Mrs. Kravitz , your husband is in perfectly good health . 
Now , that 's love . 
Supposing what 's- his- name likes you too much . 
How can you grin at a time like this ? 
I 'm sorry , sweetheart . 
Yes . 
And for the first time in my life , I feel wonderful . 
Darrin 's a very dedicated man . 
I will not get sick . 
I won 't have this . 
- That 's a wonderful attitude , Samantha . 
You got a great batting average . 
- I 'm merely being his friend . 
I think we should help her . 
Now , you won 't drive too fast , will you ? 
There 's something important I 'd like your advice about . 
I 'm merely suggesting a more sophisticated campaign . 
- I 'm being honest . 
- Now , what can we do to help ? 
I don 't care what you find it . 
She thinks she 's got special powers . 
Appear , great spirit . 
My wife has a great sense of humour . 
I won 't be long . 
Don 't you laugh at me , you monster , or so help me . 
We 're all going to help her . 
You 've done a wonderful job . 
- There 's absolutely nothing wrong . 
I love your hair . 
That 's better . 
I 'm sure you won 't mind if I make myself scarce for a bit . 
- Discretion is the better part of valour . 
I miss you , sweetheart . 
- But it 's for his own good . 
Oh , yes . 
- You all right , sweetheart ? 
Some of my best friends have knocked me cold . 
So I know you won 't mind . 
We have had good times , haven 't we ? 
- Yes . 
Oh , yes , he 's there . 
- Are you all right , darling ? 
I favour my mother 's side of the family . 
They 're going out to celebrate . 
Oh , he 's a great guy . 
Yes . 
But I wanted to help my husband . 
- Good heavens . 
She should get a medal . 
Always the good- looking ones . 
It 's generous of you to wanna make it up to me . 
Help . 
Oh , my goodness . 
There have been many times I was glad I had a spare . 
Please , promise , for everyone 's sake . 
I 've always felt I have what they call a charmed life . 
Good morning . 
- Sweetheart , you were doing your best . 
Thanks , kids , for your interest , but you don 't understand . 
Well , now , that 's better . 
Funny . 
Adorable Diane 's won a lot of races . 
Well , I sure am sorry to hear about that . 
Looks great , Darrin . 
Good . 
Now , be a good boy , and run along and phone them . 
Oh , great . 
- Well , that wasn 't very nice . 
- Yes , I can see that . 
Some of Larry Tate 's ideas are very creative . 
The Tates love seeing you , don 't they , darling ? 
Yes , it was . 
Oh , fine , great . 
Nothing but good seems to have come from the truth . 
I don 't think so , dear . 
- It happens to the best of us . 
He loves them . 
I won 't . 
I like surprises as much as the next fellow ... 
Honestly . 
Tell them about the gift , Gladys . 
I think I 'll just play it cool . 
I think I 'd find it fascinating . 
- Yes . 
I 'll show you how to treat it . 
Oh , yes . 
Hello , dears . 
She was only trying to help . 
In my job , you gotta be a good judge of character . 
So I 'll send you to the beauty parlour to have them mended . 
I 'd just enjoy driving it . 
It 'll be a pleasure . 
You better not mess around with Charlie Leach ! 
Oh , thank you , darling . 
I did it in your best interests . 
I admit that made it irresistible . 
Oh , he 's so witty and charming . 
Well , I 've grown very fond of that dog . 
Now , will you please tell me the truth ? 
Well , looks like I need an extra blanket . 
- Yes , Darrin . 
He won 't remember any more than you do . 
Well , now you know , darling . 
She must love me . 
It 's perfectly all right . 
I won 't have to play that benefit tomorrow . 
He has the talent . 
- Yeah , yeah . 
Darrin , try to relax . 
You won 't go back on our bargain ? 
They must be very much in love . 
At least they have an excuse , but I thought you knew better . 
It would be a lot easier to park if it weren 't there . 
- You better go and move the car . 
Could you save all the philosophical advice until the morning ? 
I wonder who that charming gentleman is with him . 
Help ! 
Well , I 'm sorry , but I didn 't sleep too well either . 
I know , sweetheart . 
I could help . 
Well , the simple stories are always the best . 
Oh , it 's not bad for a first try . 
Oh , yes , Captain Corcoran , I think you 'll do very nicely . 
- Now you kiss me . 
I 'm sorry , sweetheart . 
Good . 
I 'd like to meet the guy who ever said that travel was relaxing . 
I was only trying to help . 
It 'll be a pleasure . 
I wish I had my teddy bear . 
- Oh , thanks , Larry . 
- It couldn 't happen to a nicer guy . 
You 're eating like you feel fine . 
Kids , I have a wonderful idea . 
Yes , my dear , but I wish my wife had your form . 
As a matter of fact , I feel great . 
So to prove what a winner I was , you gave yourself a mink coat . 
Darling , you said yourself the shops were all closed back home . 
Did you clean the attic like you were vacuuming the rug ? 
Thank you so much , Mr. Grand . 
Oh , Darrin , she 's not out to destroy you . 
My goodness ! 
I took care of everything . 
You 've saved the day . 
Oh , yes . 
- He 's got a good chance of winning . 
Well , he should be here to help answer the charges . 
You won 't have to stand trial . 
Well , the truth is , we 're dedicated public servants . 
- Well , yes , in the beginning -- 
She 's right , darling . 
So would you come back and help us out , please ? 
This one is a real beauty ! 
But my Mr. Wilkerson ... ... he was so impressed . 
Sweetheart , Mother wasn 't in your office . 
The whole sweet deal -- 
I better get you home . 
- Hadn 't we better get over there ? 
Good shot , dear . 
Darrin , would you do me a favour ? 
As a human being , yes . 
Eat one , yes . 
Well , I hope that 'll impress Mr. Saunders . 
Ain 't love grand ? 
She won 't be able to go to Paris . 
I 'm truly grateful to you , Dr. Bombay . 
Here , sweetheart . 
Bless you . 
And I shouldn 't have to be telling the likes of you that . 
I really like you . 
Yes . 
Well , it 's always nice to hear news like that , dear . 
That 's cute , Sammy . 
- Care for some more , Sam ? 
Yes , I know , dear . 
We love Larry . 
By tomorrow , he 'll be telling the story and he 'll be the hero . 
Mother , you will be nice to Mrs. Stephens . 
She looks terrific . 
Oh , yes , yes . 
Well , sweetheart , that 's exactly what we do need . 
Oh , my goodness . 
I was having such fun . 
Oh , there 's the little darling . 
Oh , well , good . 
Oh , my goodness . 
Why , I can have everything ready just like that : 
That 's good , dear . 
I love it . 
A woman who wishes she was gay , carefree , and single again ! 
Wow . 
What 's so special about that ? 
Well , I always say , if you need a professional , get the best . 
- Doctors , please , please ! 
Well , I 'm very impressed . 
Well , it certainly was an exciting trip while it lasted . 
Sweetheart , I have an idea . 
I 'm perfectly all right . 
- Yes . 
- And a very good case too . 
It 's wonderful you remembered . 
- Yes . 
He 's good and kind . 
Mr. Morgan , I hope you know -- 
Well , calling Mr. Sharpe " Shorty " didn 't help . 
Mother , I hope you 're joking . 
- Good . 
Help . 
Come on and meet Leonardo , sweetheart . 
-- ly clever and inspired . 
Now , people don 't go around distorting great works of art . 
Now , maybe it can help get you out . 
- That 's true . 
Hey , you got a funny mother- in- law . 
So won 't you please give up ? 
There 's a great reason for -- 
Now I 'm one of the richest men in America . 
Mr. Mortimer , you 're rich . 
Now , sweetheart , come here . 
Now , sweetheart , the thing to remember is that I love you . 
- Good night , dear lady . 
He doesn 't seem to care about mine . 
- How 's my little sweetheart ? 
Careful , Mother , let 's not make her angry . 
- Why are you so gracious ? 
Darling , it 's delicious . 
I 'm having a dinner party tomorrow night . 
Let 's talk about something more cheerful . 
Sheila definitely said casual dress . 
Business- wise , she was an anchor around his neck . 
Oh , sweetheart , I am sorry about last night . 
Yes . 
- ... Colonel Stephens , but be brave . 
It 'd just make you friendly . 
Sweetheart , I keep thinking how I 'd feel if we were separated . 
Good . 
Look at all these beautiful cups he 's won . 
The main thing is mutual understanding and trust . 
- ... but will you do me a favour ? 
Why don 't I go up and cheer him up . 
Well , I am glad to hear someone agrees with me . 
Black isn 't one of your best colours . 
Well , actually , I don 't deserve much credit . 
He 'll be in line for a big bonus . 
- Better her feelings than my stomach . 
Hey , listen , she 's a lot cuter than Gladys . 
Good night . 
Yes . 
To make myself attractive to you . 
Lucky for you I know you 're kidding . 
Now , let me make something quite clear , Stephens . 
- True . 
He really is as good as he says he is . 
You are going straight home and you are going straight to bed . 
You won 't remember a thing . 
Ticheba had a pretty short fuse , you know . 
- I 'm sure she 'll be fine . 
I 'll fix us a nice dinner , and we 'll open the wine . 
- Well , I should hope not . 
Happy Times Bar . 
- Well , I won 't keep him long . 
Larry ... ... will you do me a favour ? 
Thanks , Larry . 
- But -- - You just better get used to it . 
- Yes . 
Oh , yes . 
I think I 'd better take a walk . 
Well , she loves us , and she 's crazy about Tabatha . 
Now , you run along and enjoy yourselves . 
Hello , sweetheart . 
Oh , I think that 's splendid . 
Thanks , old buddy . 
Is she any better ? 
Would you like me to help ? 
Okay , Aunt Clara , I 'll try and help . 
The guests love him . 
Hey , you 're a clever lass . 
We 're glad to see you anyway . 
You should be very proud of your niece . 
- I think I 'll try some nice loud music . 
I 'm perfectly relaxed and calm . 
It would have made a delightful conversation piece . 
Have you made any progress with Tabatha ? 
I hope they believe it . 
I 'm not angry . 
Larry wasn 't a very good sport about that , was he ? 
Well , it 's been nice chatting with you . 
Yes . 
Yes , thank you . 
I 'm the only one that can quiet her , so I 'd better go . 
Just goes to prove you can 't trust anyone over 3000 years old . 
Well , that was a good day 's work . 
Great ! 
Sweetheart , it 's not like you to go off the deep end . 
- Yeah , yeah , Mother . 
Mother , dear , please heed my call . 
I 'm hoping ... 
Yes , dear . 
That 's funny , Mommy . 
Oh , yes . 
I can always provide my own entertainment , you know . 
Would $20 make you happy ? 
Oh , well , that would certainly make me feel better . 
I did not insult her . 
Oh , Charlie , that is pretty crass . 
Nobody seems to appreciate the niceties , the gallantry . 
Oh , you are really beautiful . 
I think it was just a clever gimmick to get my account . 
Like this , sweetheart . 
Darling , why don 't you come to the palace with me . 
Good . 
I believe in children having free expression . 
Not exactly , sweetheart . 
Oh , thank heaven you 're here , Dr. Bombay . 
The North won . 
- Yes ? 
Sam , Louise and I love you two . 
- Yes ? 
Yes , I know . 
How about some nice , reassuring sherry ? 
Maybe some nice dog will find her . 
You 're going to be thrilled . 
Then you will get rid of her , won 't you , Serena ? 
- Well , that 's good . 
This wood is marvelous . 
Just because I appreciate beauty ? 
Well , you 'll feel better after breakfast . 
Oh , now , sweetheart , be optimistic . 
Henri , take it easy . 
- Good riddance . 
Oh , my goodness . 
Well , I don 't think that 's very nice . 
Now , now , sweetheart , just try and stay calm . 
Try not to panic . 
Serena , what a lovely surprise ! 
Exactly , darling . 
So innocent . 
Thanks . 
Your word of honour doesn 't mean beans . 
- You succeeded . 
I am his wife- to- be , and I say yes . 
- They call it progress . 
No , sweetheart , I 'll do it . 
Good . 
It 'd have been funnier if I 'd said it . 
I guess " pleasant " wasn 't exactly the right word . 
How nice . 
Well , it 's just a little practical joke . 
That 's gratitude for you . 
I 'm the one who 's glad to see you . 
Maybe I can help . 
I won the palace . 
- In which case , darling ... 
- Yes . 
- Yes . 
Yes , as I was saying . 
Look on the positive side , my darling . 
Harry , you just relax . 
You did beautifully today . 
Hey , coz , where 's gorgeous ? 
Well , the role of the grubby little housewife can 't be all fun . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Well , let me tell you , you road- company Cary Grant . 
Now , sweetheart , you finish your breakfast . 
My mother has the most powerful one- two punch in the cosmos . 
Is that a nice way to talk about your neighbours ? 
Just take good care of Tabitha ... 
Oh , daddy , for heaven 's sakes . 
Beauty and the beast . 
I enjoy painting . 
Wooden doors , don 't get the best of me . 
I won 't . 
I wish you wouldn 't call him that . 
It 's brilliant . 
Then you think there 's nothing seriously wrong with me , Doctor ? 
I 'll admit that made it irresistible . 
But , sweetheart , I feel fine . 
I wish I could help her . 
Good morning , Endora . 
She likes me ? 
Sweetheart , everyone is entitled to believe in what they want . 
Yes , sir . 
- Yes , this . 
No , thank you , sweetheart . 
Luckily I have you and Darrin to stay with . 
I honestly don 't . 
- Good . 
I was hoping you could give her something to cheer her up . 
Sort of short and funny- looking , drinks a bit , too . 
- Yes , I did . 
My dear Samantha , congratulations . 
And how is my adorable new grandson ? 
- Well , it 's been very nice seeing all of you . 
But UNlCEF has never had it so good . 
Poopsie , I 've come up with another great idea . 
- Well , thanks . 
- Can you get that , sweetheart ? 
It 'd have been funnier if I 'd said it . 
Once she relaxes , it won 't happen . 
The spell won 't last . 
Oh , I wish I could get rid of this ... 
Yes , of course . 
Good . 
Yes , I know . 
- Take care of my friend here , will you ? 
As long as he refuses to go back , the spell won 't work . 
At least you 'd know your child would be able to cut the mustard . 
Paxton was gonna give us his account in honour of the new baby . 
It is to be used in self- defence and with great discretion . 
" You set aside your true emotions Your loving , marital devotions 
- Yes , isn 't it ? 
Bye , sweetheart . 
You won 't miss the board meeting . 
Enthusiastic ? 
But it 's really been an inspiration working with Darrin . 
That 's great . 
It 's just that I think it would be safer . 
If I didn 't know better , I 'd say there was a spell on Dusty . 
Dusty , just take it easy and relax . 
You 'd better talk to her . 
Do yourself a favour . 
Yes . 
I wish you 'd at least try to be nice . 
It was a beauty . 
Why don 't we go to a movie and relax ? 
What I 'd really like to celebrate is your departure . 
I wish Darrin would play more golf . 
I 'm just very good . 
I hope you don 't mind my coming along . 
- Help yourself . 
That only applies to good leprechauns . 
You 're free to go now .
